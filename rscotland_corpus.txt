Hi /r/All.  Mind 'n' folly Rule 4 'n' wull hae nae problems.
/r/all are a bunch of fannys! 
They'll fit in aroon here then wae aw you nuggets.
*Yankee straining to understand*  Yes?? 
"They'll fit in around here with all you ~~testicles~~ idiots."  As interpreted by an American who has seen Trainspotting and am subscribed to /r/scottishpeopletwitter  Edit: Corrected thanks to /u/DundonianStalin
Nuggets no really a baw though, its mair like a belter than a bawbag
Actually nugget is basically the same as an idiot. 
I adapted to the dreaded dialect by reading Rabbie and listening to Harry Lauder.
Thanks you
Sounds about right pal.
This is why I hate it when people talk down on others for using a word in a 'wrong' way in American English. How the hell did new words or languages ever get created if everyone followed every single grammar and word rule ever?
Gie them a warnin aboot rule 9, mair like it tae get some cunt chibbed if that's broke.
We know Americans will stick to that one but they have a habit of braking rule 8.

The twist in the end was that England has the good politics
Let's no get carried away. We're still overwhelmingly less Tory than England. Thank fuck.
The Tory share of the vote was 'only' 17 percentage points more in England (45.6%) than Scotland (28.6%).  I'd hardly say a 17% difference is "overwhelming", to be honest, especially considering the Tories [increased their share of the Scottish vote by 13.4%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results/scotland) compared to 2015 (versus SNP's 13.1% decrease). Only **8.3%** divides the SNP and Conservatives, now.  EDIT: Yes, 17% *is* large. No, I don't think it's an 'overwhelming' difference. The Scottish referendum voted 'No' by 11%, how many would call that 'overwhelming'?
A 17% difference is pretty huge in politics.  Especially in the context of a mostly two party race.  If 17% more people like Coke than Pepsi that's just preferences, but if 17% more people vote for one party over another that's a huge majority.  The year that Ronald Reagan won the US presidency with 49/50 states, he won by only 18.2% of the popular vote, and that's one of the biggest landslides in US election history.  That's pretty overwhelming.
Are you kidding me? 17% is massive! Yeah, they made huge gains in Scotland, but they still did piss poor here. Our country is over 60% lefty if we're going by the percentage of the vote.
If you were left then you would have voted labour , instead people voted SNP and Tory. Clearly Scotland doesn't want independence yet so what is the point of the SNP? 
Do you know anything about Scottish politics? Clearly not. The SNP are further left than Scottish Labour. 
My point is a vote for anything other than labour is a vote for the tories, if the SNP were really that left then the voters wouldn't go to the tories instead of labour. 
Yeah that really worked well in the North East where there was movement from SNP to Labour in every seat apart from Aberdeen South......
You know that a lot of the tory seats in scotland happened because labour split the SNP vote, right?  Are you even British? You seem like you haven't a fucking clue.
Yeh I see it as SNP splitting the labour vote, should just become independent if you want your own parties 
That's a pretty big difference. That means English voters are 50% more likely to vote Tory than Scottish voters are. 
> only 17%  > only 17%  > only
You mean 17 percentage points. That's 59.4% more.
How in the merciful sweet fuck did the Tories get almost 30% of the vote in Scotland after the shit they pulled with the Leave vote and Brexit? I'm starting to think that [Ewan McGregor's character in Trainspotting was less satire than truth.](https://youtu.be/f1CB-D1TtXc?t=57)
17 points, not 17% more. It's a difference of 59.4%. That's quite a difference.

Scotland, it was said you'd destroy the Tories, not join them!

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Lunch Snatcher the Wise? I thought not, its not a story the farmers would tell you. 
Its a Naughty legend
Rip wheat fields
Is running through wheat fields unnatural?
Not... for a Tory.
I know you're probably joking there, but the Tories took 22% of seats on Scotland. If they'd done that "well" UK wide they'd only be on 143 seats instead of the 318 they actually managed.  Scotland can't single-handedly save the UK from Tory rule.
I mean, in this instance we literally could have single-handedly saved the UK from Tory rule.
Yeah, thanks a lot guys.
The one time our vote mattered...
It's over SNP, I have the highlands!
People voted Tory because SLab were framed as irrelevant. The fact they've retained Dugdale and candidates who undermined Corbyn too.   That and the SNP didn't run nearly strong enough a campaign. For me, they've had far too much pressure out on their weaker areas. Even still, compared to before indy ref they're well up.   It's more important to engage with the people who voted Tory rather than calling them scum and trying to tell once them. 
SNP should've only concentrated on indyref to point out its only going to happen if the Scottish people clearly want it. Basically as long as they're in power, they'll always be looking at an independence option, but it shouldn't be the focus of their powers. If other parties wanna bang on about it all the time, let them, but SNP should be showing that their main concern is running their districts. 
I thought it was written into the Scotland Bill of the EU referendum that if Scotland voted to stay and were pulled out of the EU there would be another indy referendum, regardless of who is First Minister at the time anyway?
Er, no.
Don't think there's anything official, that was simply the SNP's position on it. 
Agreed completely here, and there's lots of precedent for the Parti Quebecois falling into the same trap here in Canada.
> It's more important to engage with the people who voted Tory rather than calling them scum and trying to tell once them.  And if you've watched American politics, attacking the opponent with insults generally galvanizes them into action ("basket of deplorables", etc)

Almost certainly the Corbyn effect, little do with SLabour.
We haven't had good luck in the US engaging with trump voters.  I think the issue you're going to have is that they think kindness is weakness, use emotional instead of logical reasoning, and are anti-intellectual.  Only time they'll care is when their decisions start negatively affecting their own lives.
> they think kindness is weakness  Our conservatives are not like your conservatives. You have to remember that in the UK, if you are even slightly right leaning your only choice is the conservatives. Whereas if you are left leaning, in Scotland your choices are three parties. So left leaning votes get divided while someone who is just right of centre has no choice but to vote Tory.   Also the conservative party here is about as right wing as the democrats in my experience, maybe a little more in some areas. Our political spectrum is shifted left relative to the US. The vast majority of Tory voters are honestly just people I disagree with, they are completely reasonable people on the whole who reach their own conclusions with some degree of logic, at least as much as the average voter.   You had good intentions but you can't apply the same thinking in US politics to UK politics. In the US no one was expecting Trump to win either. Here it was fairly likely the conservatives would win, but with a minority government.    If you want a Trump analogue, Corbyn is more like it in that he probably gets the anti-establishment vote even though he is on the exact opposite end of politics. 
>If you want a Trump analogue, Corbyn is more like it in that he probably gets the anti-establishment vote even though he is on the exact opposite end of politics.  Not sure about this. What makes you say Corbyn is on the opposite end of anti-establishment politics?
although it's anecdotal, lots of my friends were voting corbyn as the Tories were seen as establishment, and more of the same (which they felt wasn't working for them). corbyn promised massive change at the very least, and many of his policies resonated with people who felt the conservatives were ignoring them, much in the same way many rust belt trump supporters felt ignored.  I also think their are parallels to be drawn between the "losing" parties, may having run a very complacent and arrogant campaign in much the same way as the democrats did.
I just meant Corbyn is left wing compared to Trump's right wing though they both attracted people who were fed up with the establishment. I can see how that statement was confusing though.
Then I wish you the absolute best of luck.
Even this comment is insulting.  Ignoring simple one-party-voters that both sides have, Trump voters have a few things that drive most of them, usually just one or two of these aspects sticking out as important to any given individual:  * They dislike the current political class, often that there *is* a political class at all. Hilary Clinton embodied it. Any appeal to protocol, to how things are done, really won't work here. I saw some people yesterday saying Comey should be president; Comey was an FBI institution who wielded as much power in his position as any FBI head since Hoover, which is the antithesis of what this voter wants.  * They dislike the current state of race relations. These are not racists (they'd be lumped into the one-party voters on the far end of both parties), but people who think the overall situation isn't nearly as bad as it's portrayed and they're tired of being told they're bad and other people deserve things solely because of skin color. The left has been pandering hard to race relations agitators for a while now.  * They dislike the air of superiority that infests much of the left. Perhaps it comes from liberal politicians standing on a pulpit telling the lower classes what they should need and want. There's a lot of acting like they know better while standing in their ivory towers -- let's face it, politicians are not an underprivileged class. You exhibited some of this yourself: it's not "anti-intellectual," and it's anti-asshole.  You've got your age-old topics like taxes and health care, but I think those are the big "current events" reasons driving Trump voters, the things that swing the people in the middle.
>They dislike the current political class, often that there is a political class at all.  This would hold sway if Republicans didn't have members like Rubio, McCain, McConnell, etc consistently win elections. At the end of the day, when the electorate diverts its attention, the political class of this country returns to the status quo. Just say you hate democrats. It's less words.    >They dislike the current state of race relations.   This one is really hard to untangle because so much of it is rooted in the hard right medias recognizance of welfare. I'd wager most conservatives have beef with affirmative action and not welfare (since there are just a many white people using as black people using welfare). What conservatives don't like is that their continual advice of (get a better job), (don't have a weird sounding name), (pull yourself up by your bootstraps) falls on deaf ears. Also, the left has been "pandering" to minorities just as much as the right has been "pandering" to the religious. Are they not allowed to find a voter base, and then offer policies that benefit that voter base?   >They dislike the air of superiority that infests much of the left.  I have always had a hard time wrapping my head around this one. The people want universal healthcare. The people want a better social safety net. These aren't things Democrats have spoon fed a compliant and subservient voter base. Do Republicans not stand on their pulpits and say "we know the way and our godliness/ fiscal responsibility makes us superior to anyone with ideas besides our own"? This criticism is so incredibly hollow. I've only ever seen it when someone rushes into an argument with their feelings rather than evidence and thinks winning is the goal in the first place.
> They dislike the air of superiority that infests much of the left. Perhaps it comes from liberal politicians standing on a pulpit telling the lower classes what they should need and want.    Here is the issue though, the left is superior especially  from the perspective of the poor who proved in the last election they really are too fucking stupid to decide for themselves what they need and millions are going to die due to lack of healthcare.  And I say this is somebody who is not fond of Hillary at all and thinks the Democratic Party  is weak and corrupt too.  But I much rather have a party that tries to do the right thing and sucks too much corporate cock along the way than the party that actively tries to strip rights from women, immigrants, and the poor and voted a reality tv star to the most important political office in the US.  Trump connected with morons in a way no politician was able to before because he literally is not smarter, more moral, or has more of a plan than the people watching fox news at home are.  The goal of a representative democracy is to elect our best and brightest to counteract the tyranny of the majority who don't know enough to make these critical decisions.  We have failed at that.

I don't think you fully understand the stupidity of the conservative party in the US, nor the way the people who vote for them are brainwashed.  The majority of US citizens don't believe in evolution, and the conservative party is trying to convince everyone that climate change (perhaps the biggest crisis facing humanity in the next 100 years) isn't real.
"People are brainwashed because they have diffrent political opinons than me." People on both sides are gonna be stupid. Maybe conservative voters vote that way because they care about the 2nd amendment,  lower taxes and want less government in their lives. 
If you think democrats want to take away anyone's second amendment rights you've been watching too much fox news.  Everyone wants lower taxes for themselves.  Literally everyone.  Problem is that the rich effectively pay a lower percentage of taxes than the middle class which simply isn't fair.  Less government in your life can sometimes be a good thing, but if you look at the places with the highest quality of life and least income inequality, it's not in a libertarian paradise. In fact, it's always a system with elements of socialism.
> "People are brainwashed because they have diffrent political opinons than me."  They're brainwashed because they think human accelerated climate change isn't real.  Because they believe trickle-down economics works.  Because they value submission to authority rather than critical independent thought.   Because they espouse hateful rhetoric about gay people; transgenders; foreigners; people of different religions; liberals; etc.   Because they try to justify the previous evil acts through religious nonsense that is provably false and not-historical.   But, it's ONLY because they have different views.   Not because people, like you, come into threads and spout provable lies and whine that said views are not accepted without issue. Nope, that contextual information has NO BEARING on why people think right-wingers (no matter the country) are evil pieces of shit.  But no, tell us again how it's just because they hold different views.  
Rejecting science and provable facts isn't really a 'political opinion' though. You don't get to vote on the laws of science or evolutionary history. I mean, I could have the *opinion* that, say, the Earth is flat, but my opinion wouldn't change the observable reality that it isn't. I could hold that opinion all I wanted, but I'd be irrational and a damn moron.   If your political stance is based on the rejection of facts, it's based on a lie - and I can't really think of a better descriptor for such an irrational stance than brainwashed. 
You forgot Obama. Anything anti-Obama flies with them. I think thats prob #1 on the list. "fear of a black planet"  etc.  When they spotted that census that mentioned white people will no longer be the majority of the population that set them off.
Speaking to American conservatives here, UK conservatives are culturally very different:  The American right certainly would like people to formulate them as just honest folk put upon by the evil elitists and the meanie-pants liberals, but that isn't really true. The things they claim are happening are pure delusion, but their media has become such a giant pile of steaming propaganda that they still believe them. They then turn around and say, "STOP BEING UNFAIR BY DENYING THAT MY DELUSIONS ARE REAL!!!" and throw a temper tantrum whenever anyone points out that experts actually _do_ understand things better than them and they should probably listen.  At the bottom line, though, I think it is true that they have no respect for experience or education and that they view anyone appealing to either as personally belittling them for their lack thereof. That, however, is _their_ psychological complex, not the fault of their political opponents. I can't count the number of times I've had an insecure right-wing populist (because we don't really have real conservatives in this country any more) tell me, "just because I don't have your education doesn't mean I'm wrong" when I've never brought up what level of education I even have. That insecurity isn't because _I_ said I was better than them, it is because they've been _told_ I think I'm better than them. I never thought that until they voted for Donald Trump. Now, frankly, I do think I'm better than them, because I didn't vote for Donald Trump. Not because of a degree I never use.  I'm not going to deny that as someone with an actual education in policy (which, I will note, was fucking useless for feeding myself), I find the anti-intellectualism that has been stirred up on the American right infuriating. It is infuriating, because experts spend years gathering evidence and building a quantitative case for things, and then some asshole on Fox News says something entirely false and whips their viewers into a furor... Without doing any of the work necessary to actually discover what is true. But it isn't a fault born of lack of education, it is a fault born of being constantly surrounded by media telling you that there is a giant liberal conspiracy to take away your guns, give your jobs away to the Chinese, let the terrorists into our country, and take power away from _real_ (read: rural) Americans and give it to _outsiders_. And when every TV in your community is turned to Fox News, and everyone at your church is repeating what they here on Fox, and opportunists across the right-wing are cashing in on your anxiety by giving you more things to be afraid of (and, of course, buy gold to allow you to survive the next big apocalypse), it gets real hard _not_ to think there is a giant conspiracy. Not because you are stupid, but because humans are social creatures who are incredibly vulnerable to social cues.  I'm not sure who these mythical people in the middle who are swayed by Fox News narratives are, but as an _actual_ centrist who gets my news from actually centrist media, I assure you that voting for Trump is the _last_ thing I would do.
If those are the big three than y'all got played like a fiddle.
You would be surprised with how many equally pig-headed people were shouting back at Trump supporters. The worst of both sides somehow being representative of and strawmen at the same time.
Let's be honest - you haven't really tried.
How would you know?
Accusing the tories of only emotional thinking is perhaps a bit much. Most tory voters I know are rather more the cold and calculating types. They have reasoned themselves into the positions they hold, but many more emotional people don't agree with the logic they use to arrive at their conclusions. Its a lack of emotional thinking that affects many.
Anti-intellectual. Lmao.  Which is it? I've seen American Republicans called the party of hick rubes, white nationalists, Ivy League elites, the mega rich, and more. These groups are pretty much mutually exclusive, with few exceptions.  And emotional over logical reasoning? Please tell me how on earth blaming an entire nationwide election loss on racism, misogyny, voter suppression, and Russians hacking the polls is anything other than emotional reasoning?   Please tell me how Dylan Roof is a bigger threat than radical Islamic terrorism?  Please tell me how sending a few hundred billion dollars to warlords in Africa is going to result in solar panels actually being built? Why would they build solar panels when you're giving them free money?  Please tell me how said solar panels (assuming they were built) are going to save the world from the effects of climate change?  Please point me to one piece of actual logic the American Democratic Party is using to galvanize their base? All I see is, "Trump is horrible and we aren't him!"
At risk of feeding trolls, I'll take a stab at it.  > Which is it? I've seen American Republicans called the party of hick rubes, white nationalists, Ivy League elites, the mega rich, and more. These groups are pretty much mutually exclusive, with few exceptions.  The politicians and donors are the mega rich, Ivy Leaguers, etc. (frankly, both parties have that in common.) Their voters over large swathes of America are poorer, agriculture states more concerned with social policy over fiscal, and the right also receives what appears to be near unanimous support from white nationalists.  > And emotional over logical reasoning? Please tell me how on earth blaming an entire nationwide election loss on racism, misogyny, voter suppression, and Russians hacking the polls is anything other than emotional reasoning?  If anything, that's trying to look at trends and results to the point of being *too* analytical. An emotional response would have picked a single reason and hanged upon while ignoring any other.  > Please tell me how Dylan Roof is a bigger threat than radical Islamic terrorism?  You're picking a single person and comparing him to a whole group. Is Dylan Roof a bigger threat in the US than a single ISIS fighter somewhere in the wilderness of Syria? Sure. More Americans have been killed in the name of God than Allah going back decades.  > Please tell me how sending a few hundred billion dollars to warlords in Africa is going to result in solar panels actually being built? Why would they build solar panels when you're giving them free money?  That's not how the fund works. Also, we could easily have changed our mind about contributing *at all* to the fund without pulling out of Paris.  > Please tell me how said solar panels (assuming they were built) are going to save the world from the effects of climate change?  Triage. If you're going down a hill without breaks and see the bridge is out but there's an arrester bed right before it, hit that bed and hope your momentum doesn't take you out the back anyway. Leaving that analogy, even if the Paris Accord at best pushes average temperature growth back a few decades that is still years of research and development time to find new mitigations and solutions.  > Please point me to one piece of actual logic the American Democratic Party is using to galvanize their base? All I see is, "Trump is horrible and we aren't him!"  They aren't campaigning yet. "Trump is bad!" is good for fundraising. But every bit of legislation that gets put forth by the House has had a Democratic rebuttal--since they have literally no means to actually prevent House legislation from being passed--that states their positions and opposition to the agenda.
>Which is it? I've seen American Republicans called the party of hick rubes, white nationalists, Ivy League elites, the mega rich, and more. These groups are pretty much mutually exclusive, with few exceptions.  The american conservative party is generally the ultra rich and the feeble-minded who the ultra rich have convinced they are helping.  There's also nothing that prevents a rube nor an ivy-league grad from being a white nationalist, especially since racism was still very much alive and well in the 70's and 80's.  None of those groups are mutually exclusive except the wealthy and the poor.  Fortunately money buys propaganda, which many of the poor fall for.  I'm glad to be critical of the democrats too, I think hilary was incompetent, the DNC corrupt, and I didn't like Obama's spying and killing civilians with drones.  The US has two fucking terrible parties and the democrats as a whole are a disgrace to politics and would be demolished if they weren't against the conservative party, who are a disgrace to humanity with regressive views and values.  I 100% disagree with throwing money away at other countries where it won't do any good when we could be re-investing in education and our crumbling infrastructure.  Hilary didn't galvanize a goddamn thing and Bernie was the only politician who had a real plan and talked about it.  Hilary stuck to populist nonsense and trump did the same with extra contradicting himself tossed in.  I wasn't happy trump won because he's completely incompetent, but part of me was happy to see Hilary lose because she's such a smug bitch.
Well said! Eventually, the whole world will reject these fucks. For now, though, we are stuck and witnessing the establishment's absolute worst as it kicks and flails, trying to maintain relevance.  I've often thought about how just how little of my parents' life advice is facially valid in the 21st century. The world is changing too quickly.   It's also changing too quickly for the establishment parties and establishment politics to cover its/their tracks. 
Look into what your parents try to tell you, then you have less to kick yourself over once you realize they were right. Just trying to save you some turmoil
Yeah, trayvon Martin deserved to die because he shouldn't have been looking suspicious in an affluent neighbo-hmm. You know, maybe my parents aren't a font of wisdom....

problem is, an awful lot of people voted tory.  The bafflement on this sub should tell you just what an echo chamber it has become. 
But the age group here skews young - typically it's the older generation who vote Tory. So we wouldn't see them here anyway.
The youngest group voted against independence though (by a small majority). I'd say it's more due to reddits left wing slant. 
>reddits left wing slant.  wat?  Young people have a left wing slant. Reddit is widely known to be far right. Unless I somehow missed all of those vegan feminist posts on the front page.
Reddit, far right?  Are you sure?
Classic Reddit swings Libertarianism, or at least back in it's pioneering community heyday. Then around 2009, as the college market began to shift focus on single-site content to aggregate content, Reddit amplified it's first real cloister of liberal communities. R/atheism and r/politics changed their voice to attract new members/spit out content. Then both US general elections attracted more liberal newcomers, along with the very new altright crowd. Reddit's current political stance is more left leaning now, but there isn't a clear majority anymore for every issue
You've got a lot of great buzzwords there, but no. Reddit is extremely left-leaning, says a US Democrat.  Edit: I get it. The United States is further right than North Korea. Europe is a bastion of liberalism and left-leaning societies that are somehow decades away from legalizing marijuana and are, at best, on par with the United States on the issue of LGBT rights. Every single American wants to go to war with the entire world and masturbates to pictures of Jesus using an AR-15 to shoot universal healthcare in the face. I'm totally ignorant of European politics but you guys somehow are SPOT ON when it comes to American politics. That makes sense. Now please shut up.
You'll likely be aware though that American sensibilities as to what is left-leaning are very different to most other developed democracies, as American politics skews across the board far more to the right than Europe, Canada and (although less so) Australasia. A democrat stateside is often a Tory here, so your sense of left wing will be different to a British person's.
There's a subreddit with a million subscribers dedicated to marijuana. The reddit mascot-alien-thing on the front page has been redesigned on multiple occasions to be holding an LGBT rainbow flag. The front page has multiple posts a week about the need for universal basic income. Nowhere in the world is that left-leaning. Not even Finland.  And for what it's worth, the British are probably the most right-leaning nation in Western Europe, so if there is a gulf between American left and European left, the Brits are hardly the people to be lecturing about it.
> Nowhere in the world is that left-leaning. Not even Finland.  I can't even begin to tell you how stupid you are.
The uk is more right wing than most other Western European democracies yes, but still more left wing than the US. Socialised free at point of use healthcare is the political non-negotiable here whilst still untenable stateside, even for many democrats. Stronger gun control is a settled issue, even for our nuttiest conservatives. Unlike European Rhenish systems were are firmly Anglo-Saxon capitalist in our economic system but still have non-time limited welfare (even if the tories have attacked it somewhat), gay marriage and rights to abortion are non-negotiable social issues even for the tories now. The Tory analogue stateside is the Republican Party, who have fought gay marriage state to state, won't entertain a dialogue on gun control, and defund planned parenthood at every opportunity. It's incontestable that, as far right as the tories and press have tried to pull us in recent times, the political centre of the UK is to the left of the centre in America.  Regarding Reddit, the guy who said it's a mixed bag was correct. Weed legalisation is a liberal issue (although only America conflates liberal as left wing, in Europe it's seen more as a realist hybrid of left and right, like a laissez-faire approach to social democracy), r/politics seems broadly more pro democrat than republican, r/unitedkingdom and r/Scotland tack left of centre with liberal sensibilities, but r/europe and r/worldnews and r/ukpolitics trend to the right. As for the_dingbats, fucking hell. Meanwhile American posters seem hostile on gun control your side of the pond whilst strongly against state surveillance and pro net neutrality. I'd say Reddit to an American is somewhat left and to a European somewhat right, with some right on opinions.
Well, yeah. The Democrats and the Tories are pretty much equivalent (this is also easy to remember because they're both blue). The Republicans of 2015 were the DUP, but with voodoo economics and more hatred for brown people. Currently, Republicans have replaced the voodoo economics with selling out to Daddy Putin and turned the racial hatred up to 11.
The only thing that reddit is being generally left wing about is weed. If it ever comes to social justice or discrimination then people get silent or use words like SJW to make fun of people who give a shit. FFS the average redditor hates feminism.
To my mind, it seems Reddit is rather economically and geo-politically liberal while also being socially conservative. A weird position, to be sure. And not really a welcome one.
To me, reddit is a website. 
Or my favourite kind of redditor: "fiscally conservative and socially liberal"
They'd love Tony Blair.
I don't think the average reddit user hates feminism or social justice, they just make fun of the ones that are ridiculous to the point of irony. You have to sort by "contoversial" or scroll *way* down to the bottom of comments to find anything that is actually bullying or hateful. 
The problem is that some things that should be seen as normal are seen as over the top by some.   Edit: I mean look at gay marriage or adoption. It's astojnding how many people are still against it or for it under certain circumstances. 
Feminism/ social justice are aspects of a particular strand of the left. I consider myself firmly left wing but loathe social justice as it makes the entire left look ridiculous.
Tell me what social justice entails for you then. 
No, as long as you stay off specialty right-wing subs then reddit is overwhelmingly left-leaning.  Big mainstream subs like /r/worldnews and especially /r/politics are left  
First the how far they lean left is debatable. Because for some people Hillary Clinton is left wing rather than centre to centre right. And second if you look at subs that are "outside" of political discussion a lot of right wing shit pops up. Some subs are downright infested. 
Worldnews definitely shifts. In 2012 most stories involving jews would have several highly ranked comment chains ranging from how jews are awful to downright nazi shit. Back in 2015 the place was a hotbed of how immigrants are going to ruin European culture but never specifying how. Plus, the place is overwhelmingly pro-Putin, thankfully less so currently.  Then there was the rest of the site shifting around during Trayvon Martins trial where reddit tried really hard to be pol2 and spammed dindu on all posts involving blacks on any sub that topped all/hot. Or when Elen Pao was around or when fph was banned or when BLM did non-violent protests that slightly inconvinienced people (especially if there was a white protestor, a woman or a the trifecta of hate, a fat white woman).  
Not /r/worldnews. "Kill all mudslimes" gets upvoted all the time.
Every day it seems I have to block another anti Trump subreddit. It is hilarious how the_donald gets scrutinized for what they say on one subreddit, but I rarely hear anything about the thousands of Anti trump subreddits being far more fucking annoying than the donald. Reddit leans far left. Very far
HillaryforPrison, Uncensorednews, Conspiracy, they even took over Conservative, so I wouldn't say they are only on one sub. That's also not to mention their subs that got banned. Not saying Reddit doesn't lean left though, the reason anti-Trump subs reach the front page more often than pro-Trump subs is because it does lean left.
The subreddits were banned because of the user base demanding that they be banned, and the left leaning admins removing them. I shouldn't have said they contain everything in the donald, but you rarely see any other conservative subreddit reach the front page.
Just looking at my filters there's  /r/BannedFromThe_Donald, /r/BlueMidterm2018, /r/covfefe, /r/EnoughTrumpSpam, /r/esist, /r/Fuckthealtright, /r/Impeach_Trump, /r/MarchAgainstTrump, /r/PoliticalHumor, /r/TinyTrumps, /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump, /r/TrumpForPrison, and /r/Trumpgret. After all these I still manage to see low-effort anti-Trump content because they move to new subreddits every 3 days to spam the same shit.  To compare, I only have uncensorednews and The_Donald filtered on the other side and I don't see any pro-Trump stuff on /r/all at *all*.
I don't know, it seems like on every political thread, regardless of where it was posted,  there is a top comment about how Reddit has so many anti-Trump subreddits and no one says a thing. To be fair, the pro-Trump subreddits are pretty prevalent but not as obvious as TD. However, when you get subreddits like ETS, designed to be Anti-Trump followed by subreddits like political humor it looks like they are a lot of anti-Trump stuff going on...but you can't blame political humor because Trump gives them the ammo. 
My [block list](http://imgur.com/a/QX918) looks like this, notice how many are anti-Trump ?
More anti-establishment than anything. Shown with the dizzying amount of people who switched from Sanders to Trunp last year.
Bernie guy here. I was almost down voted in one of these subreddits for denouncing Hillary and CTR. The anti trump subreddits you see may not be the work of leftists but rather the work of CTR and share blue.   My main point is that generalizing everything anti trump as "the left" is not an accurate way of measuring reddits general political ideology. 
Being anti trump does not mean being left wing. I think trump is a person that most sane people regardless of political ideology would be against.
Reddit is extremely Democratic leaning in its American users, yes, but politics are a bit more complicated than that and describing complicated issues with proper terminology is not 'buzzwords' and you're being intellectually lazy by suggesting as much.   It's very fair to say that the site is divided and has pockets of left and right leaning folks, and that the site has historically been very right wing. The left leaning that you're describing is relatively new as, like /u/gorrorfolk suggested, this site has roots in open source libertarianism.
Maybe it just seems that way, because US Democrats have moved so far to the right. You all are the American Torys now. 
I'm sorry, this *is* r/Scotland, right? Didn't you guys **just** give the Tories the best election results that they've seen in Scotland in 35 years? Less than 24 hours ago?
Whsts that got to do with the American left being seen as right wing when viewed in a UK context 
Of course it's left leaning by US standards, but in comparison to the rest of the developed world, reddit is very moderate.  The difference in experience is likely due to reddit beeing quite likeminded in many traditionally "liberal" issues in the US such as healthcare, pacifism, gun control, secularism etc; which are all prety much taken for granted in the rest of the developed world.
Secularism is taken for granted in the rest of the Western world, but not in the United States? Pacifism is taken for granted in the rest of the developed world?
As general ideology yes, while alot of Europe is religious, church and state bussiness is in general kept apart, religious doctrine very uncommonly influence political motions. USA only nation in the developed part of the political western hemisphere where war is talked of as anything but a worst case scenario, the god damnded president has tweeted "we have to start winning wars again", and he has support both large segments of the population and both houses of representatives.
What other western nation has secularism as as issue? I agree though, France and the UK are far from pacifist nations.
>Extremely left leaning  >US democrat  So pretty fucking right wing then? 
Yeah, a platform of universal healthcare, legalizing marijuana, protecting LGBT rights, and funding education and welfare at the expense of downsizing defense and raising taxes on the rich. Really right wing.  Reddit has a left-leaning slant. Not sure why this is even being debated.
But as a whole how much of the party actually support these policies?   Explain a president like Clintons deregulation of banking or Obama's very aggressive use of drones as part of foreign policy.   Democrats are liberal when it comes to social issues. But as right wing as most of our Tories economically. 
Except for the fact that probably less than half of those things are actually advocated by the majority of democratic politicians. 
[deleted]
Reddit is extremely right. From a Swede.  Most of you can't even see the benefits of universal healthcare. Lol 
What parts of it, outside of the cultishness of T_D? Genuinely curious.
When Americans discuss economics, you seem to completely disregard the poor people in your society. No one wants to raise their wages. Healtcare prices go up. Prices for university goes up. Basically if you are born poor in the US, you are more or less completely fucked as a person of average intelligence. Which is insane. You have so much money you could give every homeless person a fucking mansion. Instead the rich get richer and your poor are worse off.       Just realised I'm in the Scotland sub, lol. But w/e most people on Reddit as a whole is American. 
He's right about the libertarian comment.  Ron Paul was basically the beta version of Bernie Sanders
[deleted]
Oh wow, a Reddit troll who responded to the same comment twice in ten minutes.  Bite me.
[deleted]
> Every single American wants to go to war with the entire world and masturbates to pictures of Jesus using an AR-15 to shoot universal healthcare in the face.  /r/MURICA 
Reddit is right-wing for sure, it's just a fragmented audience. They hang out at places like /r/4chan, /r/imgoingtohellforthis, /r/cringepics. They used to have /r/fatpeoplehate and shit like that.  Basically every time you hear about a site-wide controversy, it's Reddit's right-wing majority getting offended about something (banning of hate subs most notably, /u/spez edits, etc.)  If the admins were prone to cave to left-wing pressure or Reddit was left-dominated, /r/the_donald and its associated satellite of hate subs woulda been gone ages ago.
People would definitely pay money for that picture.
Why are you being diminutive to me about my diction? I don't think I'm using buzzwords. I only gave a short history of Reddit's political standing. I think you could have disagreed without resorting to castigating me about my writing style.
Reddit is left leaning but its a lot more right leaning than the average millennial.   It all depends on where you see left and right wing from you're own perspective. Reddit is left leaning in economics but right wing when it comes to gender and race issues. Mostly because Reddit is mostly white men. 
Literal nazis get upvoted in /r/worldnews comments all the time.
I came.
I think it's a perception thing. If you spend a lot of time on reddit, it's clearly very left leaning. If you don't, then you hear a lot of stories about subs like /r/altright, /r/the_donald, /r/theredpill and you don't hear about how posts on /r/politics are generally anti-Trump or whatever, and you begin to assume the whole sight is leaning far right.
/r/worldnews upvotes "kill all mudslimes" all the time.
I remember there was a study which showed that while Reddit was still mostly liberal overall, out of the major social media websites it was BY FAR the most right wing.   Reddit is fine when it comes to Bernie Sanders, but mention gender or race issues and Reddit is pretty damn right wing. 
Literal nazis get upvoted all the time in /r/worldnews.
I think you're crazy for thinking reddit is far right. Bernie love, Ron Paul love, trump hate, and against policies like TPP, breaking net neutrality, etc.   You're kidding, right? 
Doesn't get much farther right than Ron Paul...
What
He's a vaguely libertarian Christian nut.
Pro-life Christian libertarian from Texas that wants to abolish social security, Medicare , Medicaid , EPA, department of education, etc, etc.  Pretty darn far right.
The circle jerk was that he was a no bullshit anti establishment candidate, who was generally honest in his decisions and not bought out. I disagree with almost everything he said but the man was and is anti corruption.
That first line reminds me of a certain spray tanned someone...
[deleted]
But he loves weed so he's actually a moderate /s
Pro-life is an authoritarian stance, I will admit. However, the desire to abolish nearly every department and program that you have named (maybe social security being an exception) doesn’t make you far right, it makes you extraordinarily libertarian. 
American libertarian is economically far right. Free market and corporate liberty over human liberty. That's my perspective of it anyway, as an English lefty 
You're literally just debating what it means to be right wing, which depends on how people use it, not on how political scientists define it.  In the USA, I guarantee you if you asked as many Americans as you wanted, all of them would answer that libertarianism is a right wing ideology, including libertarians.  That makes it true.
>  social security  If you took all the money stolen from you that went to ss and instead put it into shitty us treasury bills over your lifetime, you would end up with a higher rate of return in retirement than what you get from crap ss payments.  Social security is for dumb people who don't know how to math.
Lol Ron Paul wanting to refund planned Parenthood isn't a pro-life stance. It's purely a libertarian one, about how government shouldn't fund healthcare. Ron Paul is pro-choice, but on your own dime.
He's straight pro-life.  He thinks life begins at conception and that abortion should be illegal.    >“As an O.B. doctor of thirty years, and having delivered 4,000 babies, I can assure you life begins at conception. I am legally responsible for the unborn, no matter what I do, so there’s a legal life there. The unborn has inheritance rights, and if there’s an injury or a killing, there is a legal entity. There is no doubt about it.”  https://www.ronpaul.com/on-the-issues/abortion/
One of these things ain't like the other... 🎵
Reddit doesn't have a slant. It's demographics are skewed towards young people, but that's just because the entire internet is skewed towards young people. Beyond that, Reddit has millions and millions of users, and thousands of diverse subs, and trying to generalize a political opinion to all of them is a little silly. Reddit hosts everything from literal nazi havens, to communists, to anarchists and everything in between.
Gtfo out of here with your reasonable views!   I second this though. We have both T_D and the rest of the normies of Reddit here. 
Yyyyeah, you're sorta proving yourself wrong. "On one side we have a single medium-sized sub dedicated to a Republican POTUS, and then we have the normal people EVERYWHERE else."
Well there's TRP, other smaller subs.   To be fair the god emperor of TD is a horrible president so it's not surprising most of us dislikes him. It was  a lot more balanced when it was Bush/Obama. 
Oh boy, this is going to be a long 8 years for you
Oh boy will you be disappointed. Look at his approval ratings. You seriously think he has a chance on a second term? Nixon has a better chance at being reelected. That being said, I'm not American so if you fellas want to burn your own country down its no loss for me. There's always China to look to as a new world power. 
8 months*
>Reddit  >far right  Choose one
Uh, notice how often places like /r/the_donald, /r/TumblrInAction, /r/pussypassdenied, /r/MensRights, and so on, pop up on /r/all? Then there's places like /r/cringeanarchy with far right mods, or /r/dankmemes who are just ironically racist. Or why not just a majority of subreddits as soon as Islam or feminism is mentioned...  Reddit as a whole is not a left-wing place.
Mate they are like small right islands in a sea of anti trump left shit. 
Oh, looking at your post history, you're a Trump supporter yourself. Posted in like half the subs I listed and a couple more I forgot to list. Makes sense why you'd say the things you're saying.
Lets see... Ive removed /r/the_donald so far from r/all.... Ive also removed /r/notmypresident, /r/trumpgret, /r/enoughtrumpspam, /r/covfefe, /r/marchaganisttrump, /r/esist, /r/impeachtrump,/r/tinytrumps,/r/trumpforprison, the list also goes on, not to mention all the anti trump pro bernie/hillary stuff that gets to the top of all and pics and funny etc every other day. Reddit is left. Yes theyre are right wing subs and groups of people but reddits main demographic is young white males who lean left. Do some actual research and youll see, about 58% of reddit is 18-25, young and male. And left. 
/r/fuckthealtright   /r/latestagecapitalism   /r/neoliberal    /r/politics   /r/scotland
So you went through my post history wavy. As a participant in those communities its pretty obvious to me that once you leave, there becomes a left skew everywhere else. 
> As a participant in those communities its pretty obvious to me that once you leave, there becomes a left skew everywhere else.    This just in: Most places are slightly to the left of the places which are furthest right.
How fkin sad is your existence that you go around and search peoples history? And yes reddit is extremely left wing.
I love how as soon as someone takes a minute of their time to call someone out on their bullshit they get insulted.
They all think they're part of some oppressed minority. Ironic.
Yeah, and when you call them out, you get six new comment replies in ten minutes. Most from people like him. I wonder how they arranged that?
Being anti-Trump is just big-tent dislike for Trump, it's not about liberal politics. 
Being anti-Trump is the hallmark of liberal politics today. 
Its more like being anti idiotic politics. A fair amount of trump hate has nothing to do with his policies and a lot to do with how he's an incompetent orangutan.
Not nearly as often as one of the 50+, and growing, anti-Trump subreddits pop up on a regular basis. 
Like once a week?   Have you filtered out all the leftist subs that are there... Always?   This one included. 
/r/politics, /r/unitedkingdom, the slew of trump hating subreddits, the "against hate" (i.e. lets hate the right) subreddits, /r/socialism and the slew of other socialist related subreddits. VERY left wing.   /r/the_donald is more or less kept off the front page now.
/r/The_Donald was literally censored off the front page
Well yeah, when you abuse stickies like no other major sub does to catapult every little post to the front page, you deserve to be blocked from there.
[removed]
Because it's a fucking hive for retards and cunts, like you, so get tae fuck. 
It's like the UK of subreddits.
I say things like this all the time, but it's SO much better when a Scot says it.  No lie.  That was glorious. :)
> the "against hate" (i.e. lets hate the right) subreddits,   Heh. The real problem isn't hate or hate crimes, right, it's how mean people are to you poor right wingers who just happen to attract a lot of people who hate?
> it's how mean people are to you poor right wingers  I don't address whether this is the case or not.  The reality is this group of subreddits and users are clearly on the left, and is a perfect example of the left on reddit attempting to exterminate voices they disagree with.
Also since when is men's rights on the political spectrum? 
You must be fucking high.
You are joking right?
Reddit is far right is it? The only people who believe that are far left tumblrinas.   Reddit is home to all sorts of political views but there are more leftists than right wingers. 
Absolutely. As more of a "leftist" than a right winger, this site is heavily biased towards the left. Which is unsurprising considering its main demographic. 
Wtf are you talking about? The demographic that uses Reddit means it *should* have a left wing bias.   Did I miss the sarcasm?
Hmm, Swedish reddit is very far right, although I'm not as sure about the more international/American pages. 
/r/sweden far right?   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
You're from Oregon, you twerp, how the hell do you know anything about the political leanings of a Swedish-language subreddit?
Låt mig skratta i så fall.  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH 
Nope, but r/svenskpolitik and sometimes r/Sverige
You better start believing in leftist subreddits,  You're in one. 
> Young people have a left wing slant.  In the UK and US, not so much in France, Sweden and many other European countries - which is where a lot of Reddit users also come from.  Reddit isn't far-right, it has a lot of far-right users but also a lot of far-left and centrist users.
>Anything to the right of Marx is far right.  -You
>Anything to the left of Augusto Pinochet is far left  -You 
I voted for Obama twice, you stupid faggot.
democrats are still center-right
What Reddit are you on? 
>Reddit is widely known to be far right.  You must be so far left even the left wing looks right to you.
Check out /r/Politics if you think Reddit is right wing. As an actually conservative if is faaaaar from right wing
Reddit is very left. It's just not completely stupid, thus the lack of said posts.
I got a nosebleed trying to understand your reasoning for this statement 
What are you smoking and where can I get some.
Reddit is mostly left. If it were "far right" Trump would not get nearly the amount of bashing he currently does.   Reddit users constantly upvote climate change warnings, UBI/taking care of the weak, pro-immigrant, pro-choice, LGBT concerns, net neutrality, etc.   I think you have confused extreme left twitter users with actual liberals.
There's only a million and one anti-Trump subreddits constantly bombarding r/all including the supposedly neutral r/politics as well as r/latestagecapitalism unironically spewing communist propaganda and who could forget that time when the top 5 posts on r/all at any given point in time came from r/sandersforpresident ?  Reddit as a collective is not far-right at all, of course there are far right communities that end up being louder than they really should. Reddit is dominated by young people who are the most liberal demographic by far and on r/all we constantly see anti-capitalism posts, anti-conservative posts, pro net-neutrality posts, pro-EU/Globalism posts, anti-trade deal posts etc  Since you brought it up, Feminism/Social Justice is not centre left. This is an ideologically that advocates for segregation, female supremacy and disenfranchisement of men, whites and cisgendered people. They have a strong "you're either with us or against us" philosophy and are not hesitant to oust women, minorities, gays, lesbians and transgenders that dare to disagree with them. Just look at what they did to Caitlyn Jenner said she would be voting Republican in the 2016 election. It goes completely against my principles of egalitarianism as a centre-left Labour supporter. There aren't feminism posts on r/all because people don't like hateful, extremist ideologies and so speak with their downvotes.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  *inhale*  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Haha, reddit is definitely not right.  Look at /politics. It's all left wing nonsense.
It's very polarised at the moment. There's lots of subreddits that are pretty far right, but mainstream reddit seems to be fairly left wing.
Madness! Reddit has its peculiarities but it's generally left leaning. 
It's not far right but yes there are pockets of right on sites like it. It's not 4chan or anything and it's definitely not as left as tumblr
What alternate reality are you living in where Reddit is far right? Are you seriously on heroin or something?
>reddit   >Known to be far right   So all those Bernie Sanders posts on r/all for 2 years... 
i'll take a wild bet you post to /r/srs
True, but let's not allow such facts to interfere with the delight certain people take in yelling "echo chamber" when they're in a sub where people don't generally agree with them. 
The fact that there's an explanation doesn't make it Not an echo chamber 
That's true, but I'm suggesting that there are some people for whom it's less important whether the sub *is* an echo chamber than whether they think it is. 
Being an echo chamber is not a good thing no matter what
Seeing echo chambers wherever one goes and dismissing any disagreement on that basis is also not a good thing. 
The goal is to recognize that you're not getting the whole picture when you only visit an echo chamber and that your agreement on some topics with others may be a result of that.
Exactly.  No-one forces any of us to stay in an echo chamber. We can visit lots of different echo chambers, get different people's impressions, build up an overall picture based on extensive reading... Simply going to an echo chamber, disagreeing, then going "well this is just an echo chamber therefore I am right and also victimised" is the act of a fud. 
>No-one forces any of us to stay in an echo chamber.  Plenty of people still don't leave it. This is shown by the huge amount of folk who are baffled with how much people are against independence. 
Folk are acting as if people live their whole lives on here. "This sub is an echo chamber so you are in an echo chamber" - this sub is about 2% of my day.
Yeah, being an echo chamber is not a good thing no matter what
Allowing all opinions to be equal and refusing the filter out the stupid ones isn't an improvement either. Curation is the only path to quality, and curation requires the reject of ideas that don't meet quality standards.
Is there an echo in here? 
^^^is ^^^there ^^^an ^^^echo ^^^in ^^^here?
RUMPTY TUMPTY TUMPTY TUMPTY
So we should always avoid being with a group of like minded people?   Discussing and refining ideas is *always* a good thing, and anytime you do that among like minded people, you are in an "echo chamber". There is nothing wrong with that. The term "echo chamber" is way over-used. The only problem is when people never look outside of their own way of thinking.
If you're not able nor willing to defend your view point then you shouldn't hold such views.   The downvoting of people who are not nationalists does not give credence to the idea that this is a sub for open discussion, it lends to the idea that this sub is no more than a hug box where dissent is not welcome. 
No one was saying that it was?
By definition and subreddit is an echo chamber it's kind of the purpose. Like minded people interested parties in a similar subject.
Subreddits are supposed to be about a topic, not one single viewpoint on a topic.
What? It's not the fact they don't agree, it's the fact that this sub believes that Tory voters are some elusive and evil anomaly where they, in fact, make up a large percentage of your population. 
Maybe it's because I live in Glasgow, but I don't see people admitting to voting Tory in "real life". 
It's probably because your life is also an echo chamber. You hang out with like minded people which leads you to believe that the other side aren't anywhere to be seen. 
Where do Torys hang out anyway? Are they inside those lodges sacrificing Fox's or some shit?
Probably at work.
I'm sorry to hear about Scotland appearant 48% unemployment rate.
Hanging out with like minded people hardly makes your life an echo chamber. Do you expect people to go out of their way to spend time with people they've got nothing in common with?
Im not saying it in a negative way, but what you've described is exactly an echo chamber. I don't expect people to go out of their way to hand out with people that they actively disagree with, but you can't deny that only associating with people that share the same views as you will inevitably lead to an echo chamber environment.
> yelling "echo chamber" when they're in a sub where people don't generally agree with them  Ah, the classic "Reddit defence".
This sub is undeniably an echo chamber. Unionist sentiment is constantly downvoted and God help you if you're a tory. 
Not just this sub, the majority of Reddit is left-leaning.
Maybe, a lot of the news subreddist have insane xenophobia, racism and hatred/distrust of muslims. ANd obviously, almost all of Reddit supports guns. 
Sassenach here: there's an irony in describing a pro-nationalism sub as 'left-leaning', although clearly that paradox exists in Scotland. That said I'd the support the fuck getting out of the Union to get away from the Tories. I hope in Corbyn the Scots can see us starting to push back against the toxic Tory narrative. Its really encouraging to have the next generation step up and show their colours in the vote.   I was surprised to see Scotland shift to blue rather than red from yellow though.
I mean currently you have 43 upvotes while you reply to a comment contesting your point with 36 upvotes. Clearly you are the unheard minority.   And all of this in a series of Tory/Unionist posts decrying r/Scotland as an "undeniable" echo chamber, echoing each other and ripping apart, without trying to discuss, anyone that denies their point.  There's a fine irony here somewhere, but dear god for some reason I just can't find it...  
Every subreddit is an echo chamber. That's how reddit works. 
The mere fact you've made this comment, proves it's not. Actual echo chambers don't have any dissenting opinions.
The SNP's relative loss has allowed people to voice their opinions as more people will agree with them (the sub is generally more active around these times).  After the referendum there were a lot of people who came out of the woodwork expressing their happiness about the outcome of the vote. I'm not active in here but I came when I knew there was a lot more discussion to be had.   Sorry if some of that didn't make sense, I'm on a train and somehow ended up stuck in a hen party and they keep giving me vodka. 
> and they keep giving me vodka.  You say that like its a bad thing
Oh it's not bad but each drink is stronger than the last. There was most of a litre at the start, like 1 or 2 drinks worth left now. 
It's still not really an echo chamber though. You're misusing the word, as so many defensive people do on Reddit.
It is an undeniable echo chamber. Pointing out why it's an echo chamber does not in any way diminish that fact.
I didn't deny it. I pointed out that two things can be bad simultaneously. 
Is it an echo chamber or is that just what it looks like from the inside?
I have no idea how /r/scotland does it but i'd say to be an actual echo chamber therell have to be a sort of removal process of disenting opinions and not just a lack of representation due to other circumstances.
You've got to be fucking mad to not think this sub is an echo chamber. Any redditor I know (in Scotland) avoids this sub like it's the plague.
Fun fact. The newest generation of voters are some of the most conservative so very the 70s
[That's basically utter bullshit.](https://www.quora.com/Is-generation-Z-more-conservative-than-previous-generations-Why-or-why-not)  One study got a couple of surprising answers, the media sensationalised the fuck out of it with a *massive* logical leap, and Reddit took their conclusion as gospel because it's a cool sounding fact that makes people who know it feel smart and conservatives feel less insecure. The truth is that's it's a moronic way of summarising the body of research.
American here, who watched the results last night.  It seemed that in many of these seats, if you combined the votes of the 3 parties on the left; SNP, LDP, LP - the Conservative would have lost?
Yip. SNP have taken most of Labours vote in Scotland, this has split the left wing vote.
When the tories want to police the Internet is it any wonder the young voted against them? 
I still don't understand this old vote Tory and the young vote more Liberal. Alot of the young did indeed vote Tory.
Honestly I don't think the age group here is really that young. You'll notice the problem here is it seems the same few people spend all fucking day posting and replying to almost everything.
Also it's mostly the rural parts of England that vote Tory. And they barely know how to use a computer. Source: am from Lincolnshire. 
Hope the winters sees the cunts out 
Yeah but... Ruth Davidson is cool. Seriously, I think probably more young people voted Tory based on her than you would realise.
I'm pretty solidly SNP but yeah I like Ruth Davidson. I don't like her party but I do like her. More palatable than Theresa May. 
It's the fundamental problem with using reddit as a platform for political discussion, regardless of which ideology you follow. Every subreddit ends up having its own popular stance, and every dissenting opinion ends up getting downvote-brigaded so that it never gains any traction. Regardless of whether the sub in question puts rules in place stating when not to use downvotes, it still results in nearly every subreddit becoming an echo chamber for its chosen stance.
yep, but people should be aware of it, those that are bemused here obviously need reminding.
You are 100% correct. 
This is an internet problem, not just a Reddit one. 
You can't downvote on traditional forums, everything is chronological and regardless of whether or not the majority of people on a particular subforum hate a particular comment, as long as it's following the rules people will have to scroll past it. 
I think they voted Unionist rather than Tory, if that makes sense.
But what bigger party except for the greens isn't unionist? Why vote Tory?
Scottish Labour got undermined by Corbyn saying he was open to discussing another indy ref.   Thus a lot of tactical voting happened. 
Scottish Labour are fucking shite, LDs are a bunch of nancies who won't ever get in, there's only one logical choice. 
That's the annoying thing. These were Scottish districts, but they'd fall under the control of Corbyn, not Dugdale. The devolved government system confuses so many when it comes to voting.  Might as well get rid of it or make us independent. 
Yes the devolved system is problematic. At the rate local parties are increasing in popularity they may as well all be independent. They get to benefit themselves by making local choices instead of helping to make them Britain wide. For example Scottish university being free, if they voted labour the whole uk would have it free 
The tories are in the strongest position to strike down a referendum.   Disclaimer: these are my views and the following is speculation.  I believe the reason why the tories did so well around Aberdeenshire is largely due to how badly the SNP handled the unemployment crisis (caused by the oil crisis). There was barely any acknowledgement that it was happening. IIRC one high up SNP member claimed there was no unemployment crisis in Aberdeen.   The housing market and the jobs market were completely fucked by the oil crisis and the SNP failed to acknowledge how bad it was.   I believe that their inaction was likely due to the fact that they assumed oil would be $110 per barrel in the proposed budget for an independent Scotland. By the time Scotland would have been independent (in the case of a yes vote) it was something like $40.
And on top of that there's the fishing vote. In general fishermen have been more pro-Brexit and pro-Tory.
Because Scotland is full of self serving, selfish, subordinate teuchtars.  
self serving, selfish, subordinate? Shome mishtake shurley?
yeah, and thats what people here struggle to understand......
Yeah it's pretty annoying to see so much people who are ignorant of how much of Scotland is against independence. Especially given the results of the referendum, it really does show how insulated people in here can be from opposing views
Yup. Protest vote to send the strongest signal on indyref2.  Now that indyref2 has disappeared over the horizon, enough of those voters will go back to Labour for them to pick up a lot more seats. ( And to keep hold of the progressive SNP voters who switched to Labour, Labour just need to send them a signal that they are on board with Corbyn. That signal would obviously be ditching Dugdale.)  This is one of the (many) reasons the Tories will be scared to call another election - half those seats they won here will disappear, and Labour will gain more still off the SNP. ( I would think Salmond and Robertson would be back too, if they backtrack on indyref2.)

BY GOD ITS BERNIE SANDERS WITH A STEEL CHAIR!
Conservatives outnumbered several to one seems pretty representative.
SNP vote share was what?
Much larger than yours Tory-boy.
Final share of the vote in Scotland  Final scores in Scotland, by share of the vote:  SNP: 36.9%  Conservative: 28.6%  Labour: 27.1%  Lib Dem: 6.8%  The Conservatives overtook Labour for the first time since 1959  Not really
If this was a Scotland only election it would still be an SNP landslide.
On the archaic FPTP system...
Funny how you guys only favour PR when it suits you ...
Whose 'you guys'? I've always been in favour of a fairer voting system. 
So have the SNP - even when it doesn't favour them.
As opposed to what?  The SNP still win by with any other system, just by varying degrees.
They don't get a 'Majority' though on any proportional system. 
That's true of life in general though.  It's really tough to associated in groups with widely differing political views especially having anything close to a sensible discourse 
Yeah, there has been a strong conservative voter base in Scotland for a while now. But previously, they haven't been strong enough to win many seats because the SNP trumped them.  In this election though, people were divided between SNP and Labour which lost the SNP strongholds and Torys came out on top. Add in the fact that many people didn't vote for SNP because they see an SNP vote as support for independence.   Quite nice to see Lib Dems winning a few seats in Scotland though. 
> Yeah, there has been a strong conservative voter base in Scotland for a while now. But previously, they haven't been strong enough to win many seats because the SNP trumped them.  the narrative is usually one of scotland being very left wing....thats really not true. The political make up is not that different from the rest of the UK. The SNP referendum issue complicated it, with the SNP painting themselves as left, when in reality they are centrist, or centre right.
I don't know, theres a lot of cunts celebrating the tory victory in scotland in other threads. Its fucking heartbreaking seeing people rejoicing the doom of our schools and the NHS.
It's almost like not everybody has the same opinion or point of view ... crazy right ?
Im pretty sure everyone loves the NHS though
And being able to read.
Clean water is nice.  Rivers that don't catch on fire is usually a good thing. 
It's just extremely bizarre that people would want these things to happen. It's incomprehensible actually! and my conclusion is that they are fucking idiots. 
And in my opinion people who think that anybody that does not have the same political views as them are idiots or retards are in fact jackasses.
Also FYI these Tories are planning a coalition with the DUP. A group that are anti LGBT rights, anti abortion, CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS and are IRA sympathisers.   The same Tories blasted Corbyn for even speaking to the IRA during peace talks and now they are bringing them into government. The hypocrisy is disgusting. There is no defending them here.
Reddit is an echo chamber?! What gives you that idea, /r/socialism or /r/latestagecapitalism or /r/ourpresident or /r/thebern or /r/sanders2020 or the fact that the only right wing sub is essentially banned for being rude and racist when left wing politics not only consistent and relentlessly bash anything right wing without any remorse, but also bleeds into every sub possible.
/r/the_Donald user complains about reddit being an echo chamber.. lol
The voter turnout being so low coupled with the amount of SNP supporters voting conservative because they want to see Brexit happen.  Its not just a "Few" who want independence from the UK and from the EU.  Once Brexit is done(the next GE) SNP numbers will rise again
> Once Brexit is done(the next GE) SNP numbers will rise again  you really need to wake up to reality. The SNP is losing votes because people want to abide by the referendum, and dont want to re-run it. This is not a minor shift, this is massive.
I voted Tory because the rest of our candidates were proven to have a poor track records. The local Tory candidate grew up local, knew the lie of the land and had previously worked well as an independent. That's my logic. I voted for, in my opinion, the best on offer.
Relevant username ;)
Reddit in general is like that some people need to go on other sites or in public if they want the real opinion, some people think its rigged since all they know is politics from reddit
It's seems it's not just this sub that's an echo chamber. I assume most of us have lives outside Reddit. I don't know a single person who will admit to it. 
The call to vote was literally a snp logo yesterday
No joke, I don't think I've ever met another person, online or in real life, who supports the Tories. Pretty much nobody under the age of 30 likes them.
It's given me a lot to think about regarding confirmation bias (on a personal level).       
> Facebook 'friends' are generally people I actually like in real life,  Ah you see, I get round that in two ways..... :)
I need to add more weirdos! I edited my post as I appeared to be having an existential crisis over a few blue seats and it was a positive night over all considering the predictions! :)
The bafflement is down to the huge gulf in ideology between the young and the old. Younger people generally use reddit. Older people generally vote tory or for Brexit.  Considering the shitshow that has come in the wake of a tory led government, including brexit, I think young people have good reason to be dismayed.
Pretty much this. This sub is not even 1% of the general population. Even if everyone strongly favors one opinion, it's not mutually shared with everyone outside
Reddit generally lives in a bubble, American redditors also thinks everyone hates Trump and that he's getting impeached. They prefer imagination to reality, despite constant disappointment when they are unsurprisingly wrong again. 
You know people have lives outside of reddit
Did you reply to the wrong post? 
One of the most rational comments I've seen on this sub.
People mocked the Tory posters which simply said '*candidate name* to stop indyref2'  The results goes to show that it worked! 
Looks like Scotland isn't ready to stop talking about Indyref2 when the two parties that did nothing but mention it here made the biggest seat gains.
I think it's the opposite, people just want the SNP to get to work on fixing Scotlands issues instead of constitutional chess. 
Yes, but the tories being one of the party's you refer to always mentioned it in the context that they are the only way to guarantee to stop it. While not strictly true, a lot of people will have voted for just that. That's why a party which mentioned it made a large seat gain.
Aye, if your party has its best result in a platform of "No More Lemons", it's in your best interest to keep the subject of lemons in the conversation. Making sure that people know if they vote for anyone else then lemons might come back, and not to offer a compromise position (limes maybe?) to those people who actually *do* want lemons.
12 seats... wtf guys?
'WTF I hate Scotland now!' - /r/unitedkingdom
Honestly though I don't get it, I mean... I just don't understand the reasoning behind voting for the Tories I mean what is exactly attractive about them as a political option especially in Scotland. 
"Vote 'Insert candidate here' to stop Indyref2" I think
To me that has the absolute pinnacle of stupidity!   I can't put into words how moronic you have to be to use that as a reason to vote Tory.  I mean its not like we would have another vote on independence that you could just ... I don't know ... Maybe vote No in?   No no no that's not enough we need to make sure people are not even given the choice even if the cost of that is essentially giving the Tories enough seats to form a Government.   Well all I can say is I am looking forward to the mess they make of Brexit, so I can gloat about it later. 
It is really stupid.
>pinnacle of stupidity >cant put into words >moronic  Fucking hell get a grip and notice the people around you
Notice what? that they would rather vote in the Tories who will fuck them over at every turn rather than just voting No in any potential independence ref?   What ever though, the Tories are scum who have just jumped into bed with DUP after spending 2 years slating JC for having links to the IRA.   We will see what the situation looks like in 2 years should be a good laugh from where I am sitting watching those that voted Tory this time around moan about all the shite that will get forced upon them. 
You dont vote for a party, you vote for a leadership and a set of supported manifesto items. By saying 'tories are scum' you are automatically disqualifying yourself from reasonable discussion  Both options have generally agreed staggering pitfalls. Any unconditional support for a political party in this climate is a demonstration of cognitive dissonance. 
Alright granted calling the Tories out right scum was uncalled for let me re-phrase that.   If you were to describe the Tories in 1 word based off the performance in government over the last 7 years and particularly over the past 6 weeks the word "Scum" is an accurate descriptive word. You could of course go with "Liars" or "Hypocrites" but "Scum" covers all basis.   I do not give my support to the candidate I vote for unconditionally I look at their voting record, what they have done in the past and achieved and then compare that to every other candidate, I didn't pick up some Tory rag be it one of the national papers controlled by Murdoch and by association the Tories or one of there party leaflets and take it at face value as I am sure more than a few people who voted for a Tory candidate did.   
torries are scum though
Tories are scum, every single one.
Well, there's a lot of Scottish scum then.

To give you a proper feel for the level of stupidity, someone I know is considered the smart one amongst his friends and convinced them all to vote Tory because Nicola Sturgeon is a fascist Nazi...  This same person believes dinosaurs are not real - his proof? "Have you ever met anyone who has seen a real dinosaur bone?" I answered, yes! Me! Dozens of them. He then said, yeah but if they were real we would be finding dinosaur bones everywhere all the time, in our back gardens and shit...  So there's those kind of stupid.  Then there's my parents who both voted Tory I think (I hold out hope my mum at least voted lib dem) - their reasoning is to avoid another indyref which they think would be bad for the country.
> I mean its not like we would have another vote on independence that you could just ... I don't know ... Maybe vote No in?  Yeah cos referendums always go the way you want...
Well yeah, a majority of the country is against it and the ruling party are ignoring that mandate. Of course that influenced people.
You can still vote no. Not like if SNP hold enough seats for long enough there's a flash of light and Scotland is suddenly an independent island nation off the coast of Canada.
Yes, another referendum. Totally disregarding the mandate they received from the first one. Again and again until they get the answer they like. 
Indyref #2 was the only way we would have an option to possibly exit the UK and rejoin the single market in the event of the Tories creating a total cluster fuck of the negotiations which I will be shocked if they don't.   We now don't have that card so essentially we are now tied ourselves 100% to fate of the UK and how it handles leaving the EU.   There would of always been the ability to vote to remain in the UK if there was another independence referendum but no...  People have essentially said "we would rather not have the choice and we trust the Tories to put Scotland's best interests at heart." 
People have essentially already decided the matter. The referendum goes both ways. Do you really want to keep deciding whether or not to leave whenever the political environment changes and play on the whims of people's ever-changing political opinion. Will 'indyref2' be the last one? Or just the first in a continual 'what about now?' campaign. 
Are you saying you would rather not have the choice?   Because that's pretty baffling to me...   We are leaving the EU   We have no idea what deal **if any** we will end up with.   And your telling me we don't need any sort of card to play that might get us out of that situation in a pinch?  **Even if** that card is one you can then vote against.    Today I learned that having the opportunity to make **informed** decisions at a time when you know the facts is a bad thing because people already decided and it doesn't matter what changes in 2 year (18 months) ... we already decided. 
I'm baffled that an independence supporter can say 'we have no idea what we'll end up with' about brexit without a hint of irony. Do we need to have a country-defining referendum every couple of years? The last week goes to show how turbulent political opinions can be, having the referendum card in the SNPs pocket to pull whenever the political wind blows their way is ridiculous. What's the half-life on a national mandate? How big a change must happen to have another referendum? Can't you even see this a little bit from my point of view?
OK,   I voted to leave the UK, so in that sense I support Independence.   I also voted to leave the EU.   I accept in wonderful 20:20 hindsight, now that we have Theresa May at the helm I probably would not have voted to leave for several reasons.  Least of all is the extreme lack of culpable leadership she and her party have shown but not getting much into that primarily because the vote was a yes / no question.  Now in the context of the EU I think its a bit unfair considering now that seems to mean it looks like were heading for a bad deal or WTO rules.  You are of course correct in that the "card" of indyref #2 shouldn't be one you can just pull out willy nilly when ever the winds of public opinion look like they favour the outcome you want.   I do not think in this particular instance though that having that as a card was a problem, we have now firmly shackled ourselves to the Tories brexit plans because of it.   I see your point as to why people would of used that as reasoning now I think about it further ... just at a loss with how the next couple of years will pan out now.  Also your right in that there is also irony in what I said regarding knowing the facts before hand, We will just have to see how this pans out.  I am not in any way shape or form optimistic about the future now after this result.  I guess the best I can hope for in a sad way is that the Tories prove me right and fuck everything up as I expect they will and the public sees through the lies next time around and swing back to SNP.   Should we agree to leave it at that?   EDIT: Formatting 
Could it have been the Russians ?
'WTF I hate labour now!' - /r/europe
I reckon indyref2 will be the divisive issue. All the tory leaflets I saw focused on that. I guess a lot of people in the borders and the north east don't want a second referendum.  Also first past the post is partly to blame. Tories got a few seats with <50% of first choice votes. ABC voting tactics would have kept them out with a preferential voting system. I know that's not a fair way of counting today's election results, but my seat just turned Tory and I have the right to moan about it!
FPTP works both ways. It's helped the SNP in some seats.   I think the results across the country show that we need to move away from FPTP though. 
The result in 2015 showed that too imo, and I'm a SNP supporter (at least when it's not feasible to vote Green).
FPTP helped the SNP massively nationally as well. They got 35 seats with ~940000 votes. Green got ~500,000 votes for 1 seat. 
You can't make that comparison... The SNP don't run in England and you quoted the Greens votes for the whole UK against SNPs in Scotland alone. The Greens had less than 6,000 votes in Scotland. 
But the seats they represent are worth the same in Parliament? So the comparison is valid, because in parliament some parties are massively over or under represented based on how the FPTP system worked. Labour only had 2% fewer votes than the Tories, yet they have 50 fewer seats, which doesn't seem like a fair and representative example of the public's views in parliament. 
But unless you advocate pure PR which very few people do because you lose the constituency link, that imbalance would still exist to a large extent whether it's AMS or STV used given the regional support for SNP.
The Greens don't run "nationally" only the SGreens do. :)  
Yeah, maybe it's your bully tactics and public shaming that is turning people against you 
Probably doesn't help much that's for fucking sure
maybe instead of memeing tory voters we could engage in some introspection and try to work out why they did
The Tory vote in Scotland, especially in rural areas, have always been there. Either as the third or fourth party (sometimes second, even before the last Election)  It only took a small push to have them get the gains they did.  What's really funny is, had we switched over to some kind of Proportional Representation, they'd have made these gains yonks ago.
Back in 2010, I posted a prediction on Facebook that the Tories would have a half dozen Scottish MPs within a decade.  It's really obvious when you look at the numbers: half the electorate has no memory of Thatcher, a big chunk of it thought she was right anyway, and Scotl;and has a large small-c conservative streak.  The direction of travel was obvious.
> yonks ago.   Best typo evar  Edit:. Apparently I'm an ignorant murrican. Cheers!  Best slang ever then?   
It's no a typo.
Found the colonial traitor.
Typo?
Yonks means 'ages' 'years and years' etc in UK
We know what they did. Whipped the unionist vote into a frenzy by talking constantly about a second referendum and swung support from Labour.
To be fair Sturgeon did announce a 2nd indyref so they had reason to talk about it, it looks like in hindsight Sturgeon fucked it with the indyref announcement. Yougov's GE polling was on the money and they have support for indy at 38%.  I think we have to seriously think about parking it for 5-10 years or risk losing it for the next generation.
Sturgeon announced Indyref 2 before there was even rumblings of a general election, when she thought the SNP was safely a majority in Scotland until 2019.  Who knows what would have happened if things played out as normal to the SNP in 2019, I doubt she would have announced it so strongly had she thought May would be reckless enough to call a general.
I think she should have looked at the Tories razor slim majority and how badly Labour were doing in the Polls and put two and two together. Fucking DUP man im gutted and we caused it, England's youth finally got out and voted and we let them down.
It depends on what happens with this parliament. If the conservatives manage to get a coalition deal with DUP or LD (even though they said they'll never do it) then a poll shows 1/3 of no support is prepared to switch to supporting a new referendum / independence which would take that 40% to the 60% mark.  The SNP will work for what they wanted from the outset which is a soft brexit or special case deal for Scotland that doesn't remove or dishonor the small but significant portion of autonomy we gained in 2014.   If the NHS can be saved from this, austerity reversed, an EU deal that doesn't involve harming ourselves then arguably, a lot of our grievances will have been dealt with even though the democratic deficit will remain but that is still part of the status quo.  38% is still a very high number, SNP are still the largest party in Scotland. It would hardly be appropriate in the current climate to try and disenfranchise the Scottish electorate at this stage and I would bet that those in the indy camp that just want independence will actually be hoping that Theresa May can snatch control back from this somehow and if that happens, the conservative voters in Scotland will be directly responsible for it.  A very confusing situation politically.
See this is what we've been doing for near 3 years now. "If this, then this and maybe this"   All the while we are waiting for the vagaries to be right we are stagnating, we need to put a pin in independence for now and get fucking AGGRESSIVE about devo max, Labour/lib dems will find it very hard to argue against that as there is overwhelming public appetite for it. If we get Labour and Libs on board we could have devomax by the start of the next Scottish Parliament, watch the Tories squirm as the argue against it for.........reasons!. 
I mean, that's fair.  Unfortunately the biggest concessions to devolution were given with the looming threat of independence which basically makes you wonder if you can have one without the other.  If it's a progressive coalition, then I believe it's possible. But I don't think conservatives would ever sit down and listen to it.
Announce a devo-max referendum, doesn't matter if were not given "permission" for it. Get SLab and Lib Dems on board for it and if the Tories knock it back watch support for independence soar.  Its literally a club you can beat the tories about the head with for the next 5 years and all we have to do is kick independence down the road for 5-10 years.
Great ideas and a great user name to boot.  Have a point.
Scottish Labour and the Scottish Tories both have a higher % of votes than last G.E though, which means that the votes either came from former SNP voters or that the turnout was A LOT higher.
There were people who voted SNP / Independence to leave the EU, but there's predominately been a shift of SNP -> Labour -> Conservatives. Quite a few conservative seats were won by vote split.  The idea going around is people in Scotland wanted to vote for Corbyn's labour.
'Voting for corbyns labour'  Most of the people I've asked fall into that category, myself included. Its probably a bit of an echo chamber though so may well be correlation without causation.
Aye, makes sense. Most of the people I know voting for Labour were definitely doing so for Corbyn. 
Welcome to democracy.  They talk about what they want to talk about and you talk about what you want to talk about and then the voters make their damned minds up (the bastards).
I really should be facetious since you're so confidently condescending without understanding the point of what I was saying, but I'll put the effort in to explain it in detail since your opinion of what constitutes democracy tends to come from people who don't understand the effects of FPTP, tactical voting and swings like these.  [About 1 month ago, I would have predicted a similar result](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/68cavf/i_love_this_theresa_may_has_replaced_journalists/dgxgt91/) from the conservatives but what's happened is that there's been a resurgent labour which is the real reason why the SNP haven't performed as well as they did before. This is historically how conservatives have always performed well in elections since they tend to squeak into a constituency where there's diverse political representation because the opposition are split.  [This is why the UK elections in 2015 were the worst in UK history.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I)  The point is that Conservative MPs down south went out and made deals with kipper MPs to swing the vote in their direction to try and gamble gaining a larger majority while UK Labour were in disarray. Up north this would have lead to another SNP landslide but corbyn managed to lead a decent campaign and swing votes in their favour. This means that SNP voters were swung to labour while labour unionist voters were swung to conservatives. A perfect situation for the conservatives to perform well in Scotland.  This has generally been a core point of the SNP's campaign for devolution and independence since this leads to disenfranchised voters which *isn't democracy*. The Scottish system, for example, works through PR to ensure that voters get fair representation and avoids a majority party. This is good because it means that even parties like UKIP can get their voice heard if they gain enough of a vote share (which I believe is about 15,000) compared to the millions of votes per seat they would have in a UK election which is completely unfair.  Regardless of how you feel about a party, most people agree that they deserve to be heard and represented in government. The problem with this result is the effects down the line; because FPTP promotes two-party tactical voting and if May secures a DUP/CON coalition to press on with her manifesto pledges then the next election may see a straight battle between SNP and Conservatives with ulterised politics. Something which promoted my feelings of apathy to the election since such a thing is probably the least desirable outcome for Scotland when the UK conservative government could simply engage in democracy and actually talk with Scotland and give them the representation they desire in EU Brexit talks and Westminster decisions.  Like someone said earlier in this thread. The SNP can now run a campaign of devo-max if May secures a coalition government. With the polls stating that opposition (mainly from those who vote labour) to a second referendum are prepared to switch their support in that outcome which would put support from 40% to 60% theoretically, you can basically conclude that now is when the real battle begins.  But this isn't democracy in my opinion and why I dislike and am apathetic to the broken UK system so much and have been for many years, including during the SNP landslide before you accuse me of hypocrisy. I care more about how you win a victory than if you win a victory. Labour voters have just been disenfranchised in Scotland and paid for it with conservative victories. What will be the effects of it, I wonder?
>  This is historically how conservatives have always performed well in elections since they tend to squeak into a constituency where there's diverse political representation because the opposition are split.  No, this is you layering your own political views on your interpretation.  The Tories win election when they win most votes.  That's it.  Offer a better alternative.  Don't blame the other parties.  Don't blame the voters.  Don't blame the media.    Offer a coherent platform, a viable leader, and don't call your opponent's voters cunts.  It's not fucking rocket science.
I just explained, with a video that does it simply, how FPTP had the highest misrepresentation error and why it was down to people pursuing diverse representation. The political editors on the BBC were saying the same things I've been saying. Polls were based on this. If you want to deny facts, you don't know what you're talking about. but I'm not gonna spoon feed you anymore than I already have.
> misrepresentation error  I understand Arrow perfectly well, thank you.  A one to one correspondence between vote share and representative share is not the only valid goal of a democratic system.  
Were you going to make a point?  I do find it strange how you might be about to elude to majority rule or meritocracy when Theresa May has demonstrated autocratic tendencies clearly and the majority ruling party in 2015 and 2017 is still elected by a minority due to FPTP or that they'd rather ally themselves with the DUP rather than possibly have parliamentary discussion and amendments. (I.E: Talking to each other)  It's well established, for decades, that Westminster is an "elected dictatorship" as Trump has less power than May right now and any bills that congress pass have to go through various stages of committee, votes and discussion for elements of meritocracy so I don't honestly understand what you could possibly be thinking of saying.
> It's well established, for decades, that Westminster is an "elected dictatorship"  Yes, that's how our constitution works, and if you think the American system works better than ours I have a bridge for sale at very moderate rates.  As for the rest of your comments, I wasn't "alluding" to anything.  I said what I meant.  Understanding it is up to you.
Voters of party I oppose: being "whipped into a frenzy".  Voters of party I support: the "WILL OF THE PEOPLE".
I think it's a combination of Unionist voters and pro-Brexit voters. Also, I can't imagine split voting between SNP, Lab and Lib Dems helped either.
This, literally felt like [their only policy](http://imgur.com/Yh60KKR) was about blocking another referendum. I wasn't surprised to see the likes of Moray and Aberdeenshite fall to the tories, even during EU ref they only [voted remain by narrow margins in comparison with the rest of Scotland.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36616028)
This is the only answer and question.  Why?  Why did they vote Tory and why did the SNP lose support?  Why is the situation at a stalemate and what does either side do about it to address the concerns of the other.  Name calling and blaming don't work so somebody needs to start figuring h out how to win over votes better and why some votes were won over.
Because Labour Unionists would rather vote for their oldest enemy, than their newest one. Union at any cost.
Auld enemy.  It's shit like that that's stops both sides moving forwards ffs
FFS, I wasn't talking about the English. I was talking about the Tories. The old enemy of Labour is Conservatives and has been for decades. The SNP are the new enemy of Labour's Unionists.
It's the same rhetoric. It's politics not war.  They aren't the enemy they're our countrymen 
Get off your high horse ya tool. The term "political enemy" has been around since politics was born. There is no higher moral ground for you to take here, Mr Sycophant.   You were clearly mistaken, but not gracious enough to admit it.
No. Something being as old as the process doesn't mean it's not part of the fucking problem in the first place.
Here's a little challenge for every "Tory scum" redditor: find a Tory voter, take them out for coffee, and *talk* to them.  
Spending money you don't have to fund projects nobody wants is a good way to lose votes.
Well that's every party covered
Such as?
Aberdeenshir was tory until thatcher became unpopular in the late 80s and a lot of their former voters are now coming back not remembering Thatcher.
Ruth Davidson.
You know why.  Because people don't want another referendum and voted Tory to give the SNP a bloody nose.  
> work out why they did  Probably because they're tired of hearing "muh independence referendum" every day. 
So they elect the party that keeps on going on about it.
Why are they going on about it? Because the SNP decided to have another referendum.
Hello, are you new to Scottish politics? Scottish labour and the conservatives haven't fucking shut up about "no indyref2" and "no for a generation" since practically the day after the last referendum.  For Scottish Labour in particular, they knew that they were haemorrhaging votes to the SNP hand over fist as supporters took to rejecting the blairism at the core of SLab. Galvanising the unionist side of their supporters by consistently banging on about "no indref2" was their method of staying relevant while busy fighting amongst themselves and trying to oust Jeremy Corbyn.  It's utterly fucking ridiculous how much the unionist parties are now trying to rewrite history to make out that it was the SNP harping on about it the whole time.
After a year of the tories going on about it the snp did seek a compromise 
The best case is that they either don't know or don't understand the policies.  The worst case is that they do, and they approve of the policies.  Both are unforgivable.
I thought everyone had agreed to ignore any possible SNP problems as a cause and just rave about evil Tory scum.  It's all part of the grieving process.
1) Indy ref waaaay too soon after the last one  2) Higher rate tax band frozen at £43,000, lower than the rest of the UK, because obviously earning £43k makes you an uber-rich aristocrat :/  Look at this [map](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40176349) - Aberdeen and surrounding regions voted conservative. Wages are high in Aberdeen (well, when oil is booming...), but property prices are accordingly high. £43k does *not* make you 'rich' by a long strech.
Alcoholism.
Because corbin is basically a communist
Don't be silly just feel bad for like a week then go nuts bashing anyone who disagrees with your progressive groupthink.  You can never be wrong if your on the left buddy ;)
Blame the Russians.

You won't find Tory voters on Reddit 
Yes you will
Maybe, but let's he honest the majority won't be hanging around on fb/Reddit or instagram it's proven via demographics data that  older gen pop vote Tory and younger vote labour.   Also proven data that young gen account for more Reddit data etc.   Stats
As a small-c conservative (though not this time) I don't bother engaging on here, because it's not a discussion, it's an identity.  There isn't an intelligent conversation to be had: you're just someone who supports the murder of disabled people and wants to abolish the NHS.    Politics is fundamentally about the fact that there are different views on policy, and many people here don't recognise that.
I'm a labour supporter who thinks that many labour votes were pissplaced by us youngens thinking they would get a student load refund and stop brexit.   Most people can admit they vote for selfish reasons. 
Correct, the majority won't bother with the leftie echo chamber that is reddit
The tories won't bother with trying to defend themselves because they're scared they can't.   How's generalization work for you now?
trump supporter?
hello
Eh, you know exactly what I mean
I know. I'm just being a prick
> I'm just being a prick  Tory voter confirmed ;)
I was told it was a pre-requisite!
Woah ... that sounds crazy ... are you some kind of sorcerer ?
North East. Money. Greed. Next area. 
Scotland, What's the naughtiest thing you've ever done  ? 
Romping with Tories in the wheat-fields.
Teresa jumping in bed with the DUP totally trumps the wheat field scenario. 
Scotland... you had one job.
To not write in William Wallace? 
You can write in William Wallace. So long as it's withing the lines of the box and Consitutes a clear intention to vote.   
Um....no.  Your intention must be clear.  If you write a name in the box that is not that of the candidate, your intent is not clear.  You can write a smiley face, a tick, score out all the other candidates, draw an arrow pointing at it, and these will all be accepted as a valid vote.  If you wrote the candidate's name in the candidate's box, it would probably be accepted.  Writing "William Wallace" would be an easy void for uncertainty.
Whoa! American here. You can't write in the name of someone who is not an accepted candidate?  We have a proud tradition here of letting complete sodding idiots write in "Barbra Streisand" or "Mickey Mouse" as a protest vote - which is to say, discarding through irrelevance a vote which might otherwise have made the difference.  We take it as our Constitutional right to metaphorically discard that vote.    I can't believe you undemocratic knobs *literally* discard the vote!
No, you guys are almost - not completely, but almost - unique in allowing the write-in system.    We just draw dicks on our ballot papers if we feel the need to make a point.
You're going to need more Pandas..
Ha! This is the real issue right now, the panda to conservative ratio is all to fuck!
Perhaps this is the motivation the pandas need to finally start shagging.
That's why it's going to be a fucker if we have to buy another 12, lazy bamboo chewing cunts. 
Is that from Trainspotting?
Sure is.
Not a lot of talk about human rights, grammar schools, privatisation, the despicable treatment of the disabled, services cuts etc from tories.  But you don't get to dodge that.  That's on you. Stand up and be proud.
Opened the map to look at seats lost... [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/rRWszaD.gif) I thought I was in a totally safe seat ended up with a Tory MP well ... I am at a bit of a loss here, I can't handle this salt.
I've heard from folk in the northeast that people thought they were in safe SNP seats and voted to support Corbyn's manifesto.  A lot of folk didn't realize they were in SNP/Tory marginals, where if you vote Labour, you get Tories.
No I tottally get that literally the same shit happened in my house hold, I would not have had a problem voting for Labour if 1. Scottish Labour were not so fucking stupid and 2. If it did not cost the SNP a vote.   3 of 4 in my household voted SNP 1 voted Labour.   My partner kept asking why we shouldn't vote labour and had to explain this. 
Now's the time to explain. Just keep telling them "vote labour, get tory. Vote labour, get tory." Over and over again til it sinks in.  Every time the conservative government does something stupid, tell them.
> Every time the conservative government does something stupid, tell them.  I already have a full time job.
Did you vote?
Are you serious?   But yes of course I did. 
It won't make that much of difference anyway, both the frontrunners were poor with too many flaws to actively vote for them. Corbyn with his accusations towards "terrorist sympathy" and Theresa May with her dinosaur-like approach to thing such as: "the terrorists struck again, better have more spying on the internet!" And her complete lack of relatability to any of the general public.
Found the adult here 
DEMAND A RECUNT!  RECUNT THE VOTES!
As an American here from /all, how is it I can understand everything? /r/ScottishPeopleTwitter had me believing this would all be jibberish.
They don't type like lunatics... just speak like it ;)
As a Texan I can somewhat relate, though on a lesser scale :)
Most of us don't type in our accents all the time, and when someone comes into a thread talking all hoots mon it looks a bit weird and generally comes across as 'trying too hard'.
No true Scotsman... 
...would post such a shite comment? I didn't vote tory, but you don't get to wade in here with pish like that, we all get to vote for whoever we like. Off you trot now please. 
'We all have a right to our opinion.  ...now leave: I don't like your opinion.'   Keep it foolish. 
We all have a right to vote for whoever we like, read again matey, not to talk pish without getting told by someone else, whose identity you are insulting from god knows how far away, to stop polluting what is a mostly respectful and engaged board. It looked like trolling to me, but please explain your daft comment if it was sincere, i'm very interested.
HAHAHAHA!  'Explain your daft comment.' - how fair, and gracious of you.   The irony is that we seem to hold the same view: I was mocking the image - saying that nobody truly Scottish voted tory - by what I thought was the perfectly appropriate use of the phrase 'No true Scotsman.'.   ...which, as I'm sure you well know (...), is used to point out the absurd reasoning of people who disavow a person because members of that group would never do whatever it is that they have in fact done.   Take care, Major Misunderstanding. 
If that's indeed you taking the mick out of the image, and not inferring that no true Scot would vote Tory, then I do have you wrong and apologise.   I'm still not sure I follow your syntax, with the ellipsis used to denote irony, normally it means something is to follow the phrase or is implied. But thanks for the explanation... ;)
No problem. :) Take care. 
If Scotland had stuck to its guns, maybe the Tories would be unable to form a minority government, and maybe, just maybe, the SNP, Labour, and the liberal democrats could have...just saying.
WTF Scotland? I thought if I could count on you guys helping to prevent the tories staying in! Us English may all be insular little England-brexit-maniacs but at least we took 21 seats from them (still not good enough I admit).
well it is pretty good because they lose their majority. I get that it could be better, like they get no seats, but I mean its way better than any poll predicted. 
But now Tories + DUP forms a majority, and for all Scottish complaining that you guys never get to decide the government, the first time you ever get to do so you are crowning the Tories for us.
What makes it funnier is that in large part it's due to SNP voters switching to Labour because they wanted to help Corbyn.
What makes it even funnier is that there was a referendum to get rid of FPTP a few years ago and it was overwhelmingly voted down
Ha ha ha I laughed so hard I pissed myself and fell down and cried and cried and cried.
Could you clarify this cause unfortunately I'm Glasgow East and may have contributed to this.
Glasgow East was one of the few seats that it wasn't a completely wasted vote to vote for Labour, Labour were the second biggest party and had a chance of winning whereas the Tories were miles behind.  In many seats however it was essentially a two-horse race between the SNP and the Tories and by splitting the strongest anti-Tory vote (which in almost every case was the SNP incumbent) it allowed the Tories to have the highest vote.  Say for example in constituency X 2015 election it was:  50% SNP  30% Labour  18% Tory  2% Other  A solid win for the SNP based on that outcome but those numbers alone don't tell you a lot about what has happened in Scotland since.  Scottish Labour have taken a lot of hits and dropped even further since 2015, for this example lets just say they're down to 18% with the 12% that left to join the Tories being the hardcore unionists that are throwing their weight behind the Tories, bringing them up to 30%.  Now we're looking at something like this when you take into account the Unionists swinging to Tory:  50% SNP  18% Labour  30% Tory  2% Other  This was similar to the picture we had in many constituencies.  The most logical anti-Tory vote in this scenario would be the SNP, if you wanted to support Corbyn then we already know that the SNP would help them form a government.  Now I'll break down what a lot of the movement will have looked like since the last election:  Now what has happened over the past month or so is that Corbyn has gained a lot of popularity, many people in Scotland support him and came to the conclusion that the best way to help him into government would be to vote for Labour.  Now some of that 50% that the SNP held were unionists that supported SNP for their governance rather than independence and have also switched to the Tories, say 7%, bringing the SNP down to 43% and Tories up to 37%.  Now the picture looks something like this:  43% SNP  18% Labour  37% Tory  2% Other  Now you have to take into account the chunk of SNP voters that would rather Corbyn wins and thought voting Labour was the best way to make that happen.  Say 7% again think that voting for Labour is their best chance at seeing Corbyn in office, that makes the situation look like this:  36% SNP  25% Labour  37% Tory  2% Other  Now although a clear majority of people (SNP+Labour voters) would have seen Corbyn as PM, they voted for the weaker Labour candidate instead of the stronger SNP one which meant that the Conservatives were able to become the strongest party.  Alex Salmonds old constituency is a perfect example of this in action.  CON 40.7  SNP 35.9  LAB 11.8  LIB 11.6  SNP saw a loss of votes to both Conservatives and Labour, if the 5.9% of voters that switched to Labour had voted SNP however we'd have one less Tory seat and one more seat that would have went towards Corbyn.  First Past the Post is a very broken system and essentially comes down to tactical voting, in many seats if you wanted to support Corbyn then voting SNP was by far the best choice instead of weakening the SNP vote to support Labour and allowing the Conservatives to be the largest.
Massive fucking irony of a Tory government being propped up only by Scottish MPs.  Watch them try to repeal EVEL....
A very limited coalition, the Tories brought in English votes for English laws and that affects both their new MP's in Scotland and their DUP buddies. 
You didn't "take 21 seats from them" you moron, you *gave them* a majority, which Scotland and Wales then luckily managed to block. 
It's about the swing, we swung away from the tories and it is a matter of fact that they lost those seats. I agree it's bad they still have a majority but at least we are moving in the right direction.   If it wasn't for the massive swing in the other direction in Scotland they wouldn't be able to get a majority with the DUP. Scotland has effectively enabled the tories to carry on as government when considering the change from the Status Quo.
So basically:  England gives the majority of its seats to the Tories.  Scotland gives twenty percent of its seats to the Tories, and the rest to parties who have explicitly promised not to do any sort of deal with the them, and in fact actively fight against their manifesto.  Scotland have enabled the Tories.   
Well yes? If Scotland hadn't given them those seats they wouldn't be enabled?  The point is at least there seems to be the beginning of a momentum in England against them. Somehow they are having a renaissance in Scotland.
I'm going to give up to be honest, you seem to neither have very good logic skills or awareness of the politics of the country. 
Fair enough, good on you for apparently seeing a good result against the tories in Scotland. The Daily Politics would be interested!
From all the people i spoke to it was either SNP or Labour they voted, and if thats the case the split might have let the Tories in. Im honestly disgusted it just doesnt make sense that anyone in Scotland would vote tory. My local MP is Labour at least.   Will May step down? 
You're clearly in a socialist bubble then. 
If thats independence off the table for at least a couple of election cycles then I hope Jeremy Corbyn makes the most of his newly found position of power in the Labour Party at least, and does as much as he can to clear out the senior members of Scottish Labour who have, quite frankly, sabotaged his chances of getting into number 10.  If Scotland is to continue being a part of the United Kingdom then Labour have to do everything they can to make themselves electable to the SNP voters like myself who would otherwise naturally vote Labour.  They can start by booting out Dugdale and her cohorts, they might as well piss off and become Tory MSP's. If Scottish Labour can start acting like they're part of the same organisation that has been so positive and progressive over the recent campaign down south, and give us voters up here absolutely anything but 'SNP BAD', then they would start making the decision on election day a lot more difficult for people like me than it was yesterday.
As long as you go looking after you've had a word with Nicola Sturgeon and told her how badly she fucked up by trying to push for IndyRef2.
[are ruth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFOoRAp5QtM)
Memed the Tories back into Scotland!   Meme magic does it again. 
Ruth and Kezia are utterly unlikable, disingenuous politicians, and people who can't see through that need their heads examined.  Instead of focusing on national issues, which is what the general election is supposed to be about, Davidson, Dugdale and the rest made it all about independence. If it weren't for that, and the fact that Kezia and Sturgeon are such unlikable figures, the SNP and Labour might've fared better.   LD, Lab and Tory in Scotland were appealing to people's unfounded fears rather than instilling the rightful fear that a Tory government will be disastrous for Scotland and the UK as a whole.  If anything, I'd suspect this spells the end of the Tories in Scotland.  In 5 years time those idiotic Tory voters will realise they've been duped. Just a shame I'll have left the UK before the shit hits the fan.  I don't like the SNP, but much of the fearmongering surrounding them is groundless.  The clue is in the name: Scottish National Party.  The sole reason they exist is for Scotland to become an independent country, but they continued to brand Sturgeon evil for attempting to call another referendum.  It's baffling that people can be won over by that logic.   
A found some of them...the Tory sympathisers!! They said it's because of the terrorists they voted Tory. Said that the terror from the terrorists was terrorizing them in their territory!! Terrifying!!
Party | Seats | Votes | Vote Share Change % ---|---|----|----- SNP | 35 (-21)| 977,569 (36.9%) | -13.1% CON | 13 (+12)| 757,949 (28.6%) |+13.7% LAB | 7 (+6)| 717,007 (27.1%) |+2.8% LIB | 4 (+3) | 179,061 (6.8%)|-0.8% GRN | 0 (0)| 5,886 (0.2%)|-1.1% UKIP | 0 (0)| 5,302 (0.2%)|-1.4% Oth. | 0 (0)| 6,921(0.3%)|+0.2%    Dear SNP tryhards: Please double down with all the "progressive" bullshit while ignoring real world problems in order that I can have a good laugh when you lose even more seats and vote share next time around.  Alternatively, of course, you can accept that you have been heading down a path that is unattractive to most people (63.1% of the electorate no less) and work out what you can offer to the wider voter base rather than pandering to trivial special interest groups.  Of course, if this sub is any indication, it will be the former.  
the SNP's “progressive” stance is why they are popular in the first place
It is why they are popular amongst the special interest groups who benefit from it, typically the same set of people who believe the universe revolves/should revolve around them.  It does absolutely nothing favourable for attracting anyone not interested/impressed by identity politics (as evidenced by today's result, the majority of the Scottish electorate), and in fact pushes everyone else away as the impression is that the party does not work on behalf of the average person.
u wot m8  SNP's fortunes since 2007 have been from popular appeal.
Ruth Davidson literally kept the Tories in government. Any Scots able to explain how she won so many voters over? Was it mainly to do with appealing to unionists?
In short, she appeals to -   1. Unionists - the Tories seem to have acquired almsot all the unionist vote.  2. Brexiteers - 38% of Scotland voted for Brexit and the Tories are delivering that.   3. Small-c conservatives - Scotland isn't much more left-wing than England, and the Scottish tories attract the votes of people who lean right but don't support the SNP.
The Scottish conservatives changed their name to The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. They campaigned hard on the referendum issue and posited themselves as the party that would put up a staunch fight against independence.  This attracted a big enough vote change to push them over the line in a few areas where they were the second party last time.  Independence is important enough of an issue that this attracted the vote of enough labour voters who saw Corbyn and his SNP-sympathising to be a threat to the union. Thus providing those crucial seats.
What does Tory mean - American
Slang for Conservative Party member / MP
I think OP has just secretly confessed to voting for the Tories.  For those who haven't seen Trainspotting, [here's](https://youtu.be/SUZyNLZZjMs?t=2m43s) the scene and context.
I voted Tory - come at me - I'll take you all on.   On a more serious note: posts like this are what makes politics tribal. People should be free to vote who they want without fear of being lynched etc.   I always voted Lib-Dem, but when the SNP got voted into my area with less that a hundred majority I switched to the party that had the best chance of beating the SNP. I don't like May or her hair brained idea of regulating the internet, changing human rights laws that don't suit her or taxing the vulnerable - but I hate the SNP even more because they will not let indeyref go and have been horrendous at representing Scotland in Westminster. If Sturgeon had come out after Brexit and not called a second independence vote - May would never have had to stand up to her. May stopping Sturgeon (the first Westminster politician in years to do so as everyone down there seems terrified of the SNP) motivated so many people to vote Tory as there seemed to be a party that would finally just tell the SNP to gtfo. 
"I'm voting for a party that will not hesitate to marginalise me because fuck Sturgeon".  Cool.
 your angst is showing 
Thanks. 
[deleted]
> People should be free to vote who they want without fear of being lynched etc  Not really mate, especially when those policies that a party suggests has consequences. 
All parties policies have consequences. I've never voted SNP and have had to live with the consequences over their curriculum for excellence or their changes in the tax rates for buying property - but I'm not going to attack people for voting SNP. 
What consequences for the curriculum for excellence? Is it the most amount of students going to university in history? The most apprenticeships being given out in history? The second most highers awarded in history? Based on that I'd say those consequences are pretty fucking good. Let me guess what happened here. You saw that the literacy rates had fallen and assumed the whole thing is a failure. You didn't look into those figures because if you had you would have seen that the year with the low pisa scores then went on to score the second most highers in history. Additionally the number one cause of illiteracy in children is child poverty and hey wouldn't you know that has risen with the tory government. To counter this the snp have introduced measures to bring children into nursery at an earlier age allowing the parents to work more and introducing free meals to ease financial strain where there need not be it. So, I would say education is a massive fucking success but yeah let's vote for the massive cunts that are the tories because one aspect of government doesn't look good. This is why you research before you fucking vote.
> What consequences for the curriculum for excellence?  My university falling out the top 100, my nephews having subjects cut at school as they no longer fit inside the new frame work. I didn't believe the literacy rates, but thanks for assuming.   > Introducing free meals  Free school meals for the poor have been around for years. I had them the entire time I was at school, its not new.  > Apprentices  This was a Tory push that other parties have piggy backed off.   > So, I would say education is a massive fucking success but yeah let's vote for the massive cunts that are the tories because one aspect of government doesn't look good.  Education is fully devolved to Scotland and has been for years. Also the Scottish parliament now has its own tax raising powers - the Torys have no say on Cuts in Scottish schools.   > This is why you research before you fucking vote.   Based on the above I would suggest that you should research what is actually devolved and not.
Universities rise and fall. To be honest I cannot talk about that because I have no idea which university you are talking about. Free school meals have existed but I would remind you that it was the snp led Scottish government that introduced free school meals to all students from primary 1 to 3. This is a massive help to those trying to make ends meet with young children and goes a long way to combat child poverty. The tory push for apprentice ships has gone terribly. It is disproportionately used by richer families who don't need it. Apprenticeships need to be available to poorer families who need someone to immediately go into work whilst learning at the same time. Not for richer families using the £2bn when they don't need it. The cuts were not directly to education they were to a hell of a lot of other things that have seriously hurt poorer Scottish families. The entire austerity system has devastated a great deal of families. Now, I would remind you of the removal of tuition fees. This is most definitely on of the best things to happen  in Scotland for a long time. Universities are more full than they have ever been because of this. I am going to university soon and I know for damn sure that I would not be going without that support. That is something the tories have very much been against at least in England. That it absolutely ridiculous. 
Just has a thought it might be universal free meals you are talking about and I'm talking about something different as I has free ones my entire school time. (I.e. means tested ones)  My experience of apprentices is very different- but probably based on my peer group rather than data (I.e. My friends who didn't go to uni went and got apprenticeships and they came from backgrounds like mine).   Tuition fees still exist in Scotland - just they bypass your wallet entirely, the government still has to pay for them. I actually agree tuition fees are ridiculous in England but I would have still gone to uni even with the high fees. But when I left school too many people were saying 'I'm just going to uni for something to do' rather than studying for a specific job/interest/reason. We need uni to be a place people go to study for a specific reason rather than just the next step from School otherwise those who don't do well academically at school will be left behind and the government is basically funding a third step in the education system for all were no other country does so.   Thanks for the more level response. The pointy fingers assuming people's opinions/backgrounds always wind me up.   Good luck at Uni!! 
Tuition fees do exist yeah but not in a way that impacts the students too much. Thing is there is just no way I would be able to afford to go at all. Especially for the course I want to (game design) I will forever be thankful to the SNP for that. I have definitely seen that attitude towards Uni where it is just something to do but in my experience there are far more people wanting to go because they can get the career they want out of it.   Apologies for the finger pointy I just get very frustrated over this. In my opinion, education is the single most important part of a country. A country cannot exist without a decent education system so to see funding be slashed by the Tories hurts me and then to see them pour salt on the wound by blaming the Scottish performance on the SNP digs deep. I will never be able to understand voting Tory  but I know there are a lot of people who think the same way about the SNP. The fact of the matter is we need parties that really care for scotland and other than UKIP I believe they all do. We need to stop this "us vs. Them" thing that has overtaken politics and find ways to work together. Thanks for the good luck!
So basically hate was the main motivation behind your vote? Wouldn't mind bumping into you on a dark lane...
Wow. Report to police "implied threat of violence" if I were you. 
It was actually sarcasm.  People like you scare me, the Trumps of the world.
Oh dear. Let's leave this here than. Threats of violence, personal insults. The irony being that's how trump would act. 
The very fact that you're threatening me with the police when you're probably (hopefully) aware that that's an old Scottish saying for someone who gives you the heebie-jeebies proves my point that you're either a person with dangerous views, or a troll.    What do I mean by dangerous? You couldn't give a single good reason why you voted Tory other than 'I hate the SNP', that is scarily flawed logic. Furthermore, you disagree with Theresa May's policy of robbing our civil liberties, but don't care because you hate Sturgeon.  That's absolutely crazy because you're an ex Lib Dem voter, and the above reason (among others) is precisely why people vote Lib Dem in the first place. Those, my friend, are the kinds of opinions that give rise to dictatorships (not that the UK isn't one anyway, the ignorance among the electorate is palpable - thanks to the constant mind-rape by the mass media). By what you've said, you don't care about anything but your own hatred.     Bear in mind, I have Tory friends but they can at least make an attempt to argue for, and vote for their views by means of rational discussion and deliberation, not through blind impulse. People who have such incongruent views are capable of anything.
Oh wait - that was a reply to me. Sir - you are welcome to your political views and free to vote how you wish as am I. But seriously? Moaning about me being motivated by hate and then threatening me with your hate?   Fine - bring it. Where're do you live? More than willing to met up and find a dark alley.
Well I mean thanks for the current hellscape you've landed us in, I'm sure the Tory-DUP coalition won't actually follow through with taxing the poor to death, destroying human rights, and regulating the internet, but I'm glad you got the pesky SNP out of your area, thanks, prick.
16 year old from England here; correct me if I'm wrong but the SNP lost so many seats because of Sturgeon's huge push of her main agenda being a second referendum which most of you didn't want right? Or is there some other reason behind it? Because both me and my dad expected 45-55 seats for the SNP in Scotland which we expected to allow a Labour SNP coalition to be formed. 
[deleted]
> correct me if I'm wrong  Alright then. I haven't heard of fraction of the Indyref2 chat from the SNP that I've heard from Scottish Labour and (mostly) the Tories here. The Tories entire platform up here was "No To Indyref2". We got bombarded with Tory leaflets here with no mention of any policies apart from "No to Indyref". Plenty of unionists rally round that message, and I'd imagine that a number of the 2015 Labour "No" voters would tactically vote Tory to keep the SNP out.  Labour's manifesto was bold, and attracted a lot of the left-wing "old Labour" vote that the SNP assumed when Labour was seen to be standing side-by-side with the Tories in 2014 and beyond. I know people that voted Labour in this election because of their manifesto (and Corbyn) *in spite* of how useless and un-Labour-like Scottish Labour have been recently. There are other old Labour voters now SNP who have vowed never to go back.  So in short, there was significant amount of SNP -> Labour, and Labour -> Tories. Labour's manifesto was strong and people wanted to support it. And for others, the "no to Indyref" message was more important than who runs the country. Those fears were capitalised on by the Tories who made it their only message.
There are lots of reasons, but I think the main ones are -   1. Indyref2. Sturgeon pushed for it hard before the general election was called. The opinion polls have consistently shown that it wasn't really wanted a by a majority. Although the SNP cut back heavily on mention of independence during the GE campaign, the Scottish Tories didn't. The Scottish Tories are widely seen as the only dependably unionist party.   2. Scotland has its fair share of small-c conservatives. We're not an overwhelmingly left wing country. The SNP certainly attracts a lot of the centre-right and right wing vote (Tartan Tories). But for people who are conservative and don't like the SNP, then the Tories are pretty much the only conservative party to vote for.   3. Brexit. 38% of Scotland voted for Brexit, but didn't have anyone that really represented them aside from the Tories. Most Scottish parties are very pro-EU but the Tories are the ones implementing Brexit.   4. Ruth Davidson. She's recognisable, charismatic and speaks and argues well. She provides th Scottish Tories with a likeable figurehead.   5. Local issues. I live in Gordon, where the Tories unseated Alex Salmond. The Tory candidate (now MP) is from a farming family. He played that up, along with playing up the mismanagement of CAP payments to farmers in recent years. 
This is well put, but I think you could add a growing *perception* that the SNP have twiddled their thumbs and focussed on constitutional issues, not using the powers held at Holyrood sufficiently to justify blaming falling relative GDP, education and public services on the Tories. They've been in power in Scotland for ten years and could raise taxes if they really wanted to prioritise helping in the here and now rather than preserving the political capital to crow bar another referendum. Sturgeon's speech today mentioned reflecting carefully on the results of this. I'm a unionist but will greatly respect a shift to focussing their considerable talents and energy on issues in Scotland they truly do have control over. 
It's the reason I never voted for them this time.
The amount of folk on Facebook blaming 'fuckin huns' is both hilarious and pure cringe
[deleted]
Lies and apathy.
Yeah WTF is going on, .I blame the fishermen and farmers, don't know what they were thinking, this won't save their eu incomes or protect the fleet, this will be negotiated away by May/ Bojo as they have no care for us Scots. Also in Moray the population is about 35-40% English as they all retire and move north for the perks that they don't get down South. What a bunch!
TIL being a farmer in Moray makes me a tory loving devil. 
You might not be, but you'll know fine well that plenty of your neighbours are.  Not devils, per se, but thicker than pig shite and ready to believe any arsehole who tells them they'll magically make more money, while providing absolutely zero proof of how their party will make this miracle come to pass.
What an obnoxious viewpoint. You do realise that's exactly what some unionists think of the independence supporting voters right? 
You do realise that I am past fucking caring right?  Let the whole place just revert to the Dickensian nightmare that these people obviously long for, and richly deserve.
You can not care all you want.  Your attitude is why your side had a bad night.  You don't get to choose or change your electorate.  I'm not going to engage with someone who calls me "thicker than pig shit".  
And yet, that's exactly what you're doing with your comment.    I can see I was totally wrong about *you*...
Thanks, you've really persuaded me to reconsider.  
I don't think he was trying to get you to reconsider, actually. Damn he was right though, thicker than pig shit.
> I don't think he was trying to get you to reconsider, actually.  Gosh, really?
I thought you didn't care to engage with someone like me?  And now you're disappointed that I'm not trying to play Voter Intervention with you?    Your ignorance and poor decision-making are not my problem.  Burn the whole country to the ground, if you like.  Just don't expect sympathy when the flames finally make it to your roof.
> ignorance  ahahahaha  Look, when you make assumptions about strangers, you get things wrong.  Assuming I am clueless is one of those things.  
Calm down dear, there is zero chance of the tories being able to pass anything ideological and particularly dickensian in this parliament. They have both euro skeptic and euro philic elements, either of which will probably dislike whatever brexit deal is reached. The euro skeptics' votes in parliament can be replaced however, with support from a now rejuvinated Labour party, so the direction of travel is now clearly going to be towards what is agreeable to Corbyn and co. without pissing off the largest contingent of Tories, who are not especially hard line. With UKIP a genuine threat pre 2017, it was always the euro skeptic tail wagging the ambivalent dog, IMO. The only thing that's been firmly kicked into touch is another independence referendum on the SNP's timescale. 
You're probably right, and believe, that is a relief.  But if you're wrong, and May remains in power, and they really go fully, balls-out, far-right...it just doesn't matter anymore.  I really am out of fucks to give.   
Well I sympathise with that greatly. I will be very disappointed if they don't tack to the centre, and next time around I hope everyone else will give the tories a deserved kicking for polarising the country if that's the short sighted route they take. 
NE here, and you see Tory banners is so many farmers fields so you the stereotype is often justified. 
Yeah, we drove over that way at the weekend, and it was just weird. Felt like the bloody twilight zone.
Honestly didn't see this coming, how someone could vote Tory and think its going to improve things is beyond me.   I never considered local people were actually stupid till now but if anything, the silver lining is when the Tories make a train wreck of Brexit I can freely gloat about it. 
Admittedly this is a repost, but I think it's more accurate seeing 12 seats go to the Tories in Scotland. 
I'm honestly just here for the banter lads, nae need to throw around buzzwords.
I doubt that's gonna build much *synergy*

Why are leftists on Reddit so fucking cancerous?
The rich, the retired, the retarded and the racist. That's who voted tory.
Couldn't be people who don't want indyref2 or people who don't like how the SNP runs Scotland though?   No lol MORE BUZZWORDS! 
Well they come under the retard category, because this was a Westminster election, not a Hollyrood election.
Clearly if the SNP had maintained their Westminster seats, Sturgeon would have put indyref straight back on the agenda.
Spot on ... voting Tory in a UK election won't stop IndyRef2 - the SNP control the Scottish parliament and so this has no effect.  And you are spot on, if people don't like how the SNP is running Scotland then voting Tory here is retarded.   The SNP result last General was a fluke, many seats were highly marginal anyway. This is the result of people voting on the Unionist/Independence issue and those not wanting Independence voting Tory whilst the SNP support got split by people wanting to oust the Tories by voting Labour (which would not have worked, but seems they tried regardless).  The SNP had no power at Westminster whatsoever, even with almost every Scottish General seat - this doesn't change anything at all really.
People who voted Tory because they don't want Indyref 2 are bloody idiots. Labour opposes it too, so Tory wasn't the only option. Besides, if Indyref 2 had happened, *voting No would still have been an option*.   Voting Tory in a Westminster election because you don't like how the SNP runs Scotland from Holyrood is also bloody stupid. If you don't like the Holyrood government, vote against them at the Holyrood elections. Scotland only holds 59 seats at Westminster so it's not as if the SNP wields any real power down there. 
I think the reason they chose to vote Tory instead of Labour is because a large number of SNP seats would most likely have lead to the formation of a Labour SNP coalition government, which most likely would have only happened under the conditions that a second indyref was to be carried out.  Though I do agree that they should have just voted Labour or SNP and then said no when indyref2 came around. 
You do know you can vote SNP then vote NO if there was another independence referendum right? I like the SNP as they represent Scotland. I was a yes voter, but im now a no voter. A vote for SNP isnt strictly a vote for independence.
Why have you changed your mind on independence? I'm curious to know.
The uncertainty has crept up in the back of my mind. The decrease in supporters for another independence referendum. A surge in tory voting shows that Scotland is more divided than ever. We're not ready. We need to all be behind the SNP and they need to be behind us if we really want another referendum. If the next one fails, it will be our last. 
30% of Scotland are retired, racist retards?
Wow, you've really made me rethink my views.  I was a Tory voter but now I realise I'm a rich retired retarded racist I've really changed my tune.  Clearly the lesson of this election is that Tory voters weren't insulted enough.
I wasn't trying to make you rethink your views. Its current too late, we've all voted. And I wasn't saying you had to be all of the following to be a tory voter.  The rich will vote tory as they'll not tax high earners as much. Plus you know, fuck the poor.  The retired will vote tory as they've been led to believe that independence would fuck up their pensions and therefore, vote tory to not get independence.  The racists will vote tory as they love the idea of getting immigrants out of this country. Brexit might achieve that since it means withdrawing from the European Union and must mean that they'll be no more foreigners!  Then there's the retards who vote tory as they mistakenly think that voting tory will get rid of the SNP from Scotland because they run it so terribly! Except we were voting to see who represents us in London. Not voting for the people who actually run our communities. That was the other vote we all done a few months back. Im sorry to have offended you, but this is how I see it.  If the shoe fits, feel free to pick as many as you'd like to wear though.   
Whoosh.
I did, proud to say so and so glad to see my constituency of Stirling is now a blue one. So enjoy crying together in your echo chamber.
Pretty much everyone is laughing at how badly the Tories are doing.  They threw a 20 point lead.
And laughing at the nationalists because the independence dream is dead. 
Given how this is a UK election and not a Scottish one, the people who are laughing for that reason must be pretty retarded.
Hahahahah nats in denial. INDY REF 2 IS DEAD. Don't think I'm retarded for clearly seeing an election in Scotland with independence the main issue has shown us that the people of Scotland don't want one. 
Pretty sure this wasn't a Scottish election with Independence being the main issue. Pretty sure this was a UK election for Westminster.
Indyref2 was a big barking point for Scottish voters. One of the reasons I never voted SNP was they couldn't let it go. If they focused on devo then they would have had my vote.
Well there's already been a mandate and they won the Scottish elections and comfortably got the majority in Scotland in this UK election.  Don't think they have much to worry about.
That mandate that was blocked by May? 
It hasn't.
Did you see the election results? Showing that the SNP hold a majority of seats in Scotland?
Yeh I saw the SNP have net loses worse than any other party, overall vote collapse, lose the most well known MPs and now have no safe seats. RIP Indy ref 2
Politics is ever changeable, nothing is certain. Indy Ref 2 can cook away on a back burner quite comfortably for a few years if needed.
Try engaging people in debate with substance then instead of going...na na na na na...thats what idiot children with no clue about the world do!!

Hahaha, class.
When I lived in Stirling it was an incredibly safe seat for Labour with Ann McGuire. Then it went SNP and now it's a Tory seat. Crazy how much things have changed in such a short period of time.
I'm choosing to believe the vote in Moray was due to misplaced anger about the Dandy Lion. When something truly revolutionary breaks through society's barriers there is always an ugly backlash. 
Can anyone ELI5 for me? 
The results of yesterday's General Election are out. The Tories have lost their majority and have lost seats everywhere in the UK apart from Scotland. In Scotland they went from 1 seat to 13. 
Who are the tories anyway? I've heard that so much but never got what it was
It's a nickname used for the Conservative Party. A Conservative is a Tory, the party are the Tories.   In the 16th - 18th century, the British parliament had two main groups. They both came up with insulting names for each other. Tory (meaning robber or brigand) and Whig (meaning cattle driver).  The insulting names stuck to both groups. The Tories are still here, but the Whigs kind of dissolved in the mid-19th century. 
the Conservative Party
Why is that bad though? Shouldn't each party have a significant number of seats?
/r/scotland is heavily left-wing and pro-independence. The Conservatives are right-wing and pro-union. So they are not popular here at all.   It's also somewhat surprising - the Conservatives have had only 1 MP in Scotland since 1997, so the sudden growth in popularity is a shock to many. 
A Trainspotting reference is always appreciated
A lot of people aren't leaving then 
I'm no scot, but the first thing that I thought of seeing the meme was this fine scene, at 36 seconds.  https://youtu.be/7PPbVCfAu5E?t=36
When you have the Tory Fear Factor going in full pelt, as per, it's clear a few gullible SLab/SNP/Other supporters are going to flock to them - especially if they were pro-SNP but pro-union.  But thanks to those short sighted, easily fooled, history ignorant folk we've got more blue north of the border than there ever should be, and that cost a Labour/SNP coalition its victory. For once England started getting it shit together and we let the ball slip. Fo'shame 
 This made me laugh far more than it should have.

Reading comments with Begbie's voice 
this post made my weekend much better
Sturgeon gambled and lost.  She gambled that pro-independence feeling, plus anti-Brexit feeling, would equate to an SNP surge. So she went all in - indyref 2 - before seeing the last card.  It was a massive mistake. She missed the combination of electoral fatigue, resurgent unionism, surprisingly strong Brexit sympathy in fishing and farming areas, and a 'fair play' sense of acceptance that Brexit needs to go ahead, like it or not. There was also some domestic dissatisfaction with the SNPs record in Scotland, which left the 'day job' mantra ringing very true.   The gamble failed. Ruth Davidson is the clear winner from last night. It doesn't put independence altogether out of the question, but it does mean the SNP have a long, slow climb ahead after they take a long, slow look in the mirror.
Lock the doors. Bring me a shovel.

Aye, that famous Londonistan resident Francis Fuckin' Begbie.
36% vote share for SNP, 29% apiece for Labour and Tories suggest it's more than the odd Tory.   And how delightful to see Salmond go as well. 
Labour supporter, voted SNP, got tories. FML.
The SNP fucked everyone.
Yeah and the Tories have fucked no one. 
My dad did because he gets a kick out of fucking over poor people even of he gets fucked in the process.
Didn't think I'd ever see the day where the Tories had more than one seat in Scotland. I honestly don't know what these people want, cause so far what the Tories are doing isn't working.
They had more in the 1980's 
My blood is still fucking boiling over this! After decades of moaning, bitching and whining how Tory governments are forced upon them the Scottish gains allow  them to fall over the line.  We won't let you ever forget this.  Traitors.
Oh fuck off you cunt.
Frustrating times. Scotland had a good reputation of not being a daft cunt when it comes to politics and people decided that Tory was a good idea now? Ridiculous 
Ferguslie park voted tory in their local election. It tells you all you need to no. There is so little faith in Corbyn due to his IRA 'pals' and the same in the SNP, (Sturgeon and Salmond had their photo taken with an IRA collection box), so I guess protestant Scotland feels the Tories are the only party for them on religious grounds
Scotland went Tory, Wales and England went Labour.   What the fuck just happened?
Not really accurate. Scotland was predominantly SNP. Wales voted a majority of Labour MPs in. England voted in mostly Tory MPs.
I mean went as in the change, most unexpected.
Ah right. Well there's a bit of an ebb and flow to it. Labour did so poorly in 2015 that an improvement was always a distinct possibility.  And the SNP did so extraordinarily well in 2015 that it was inevitable that they'd lose *some* seats. But to the Tories?!  Disgusted.
The Tories didn't win England?
If you look at who voted tory, Its mainly the north with majority of them being folk who are ready to retire or have moved up north from England 
How do you know that? 
moray has a lot of exmilitary who remained in the area after leaving the armed forces.  Also lots of farmers and fishermen.  Winnie Ewing will be disgusted with the people of Moray for voting to end the NHS as am I.  now we have a right wing governement in the uk only having gained the position due to support from paramilitary groups in north ireland.
I too like to speculate wildly from the comfort of my paddling pool
He's not wrong, Angus seems to be gradually turning into some sort of large scale retirement community.
As an outsider I always thought of Scotland as the saner, more progressive alternative to England. Boy do I need to rethink my judgement.. 
 I guess you've never seen an orange March in Glasgow then....

Lets be real  Prospects of IndyRef2 have hurt SNP.   It sucks, but its the truth. 
My fucking thoughts exactly! 
Alright, I may not like SNP, and I'm glad they have less seats. But I did not fucking want half my country to turn into Tories.  Lets go kick 'em in the pods!
Scotland was a wee bit disappointing.. but hold your breath, gentlemen. I don't think this bizarre coalition will last long, so you will have another try to correct your vote.

Sweden democrat is nationalist, but also most definately a leftist socialist party, in particualar by US standards. They are for free universal healthcare, social benefits, free schools, regulated market, high taxes (30-50%) etc.  While Germany took in more refugees they are a country with a 10 times larger population and they shut their borders alot earlier than Sweden.   Also Hungary is an unbelievably bad example, while it might ve true that more refugees came to Hungary, it's not in any way true that they welcomed more refugees. Throughout the crisis Hungary was time upon time critizised for it's subhuman treatment of the people seeking asylum, with numerous assults on refugees by border guards, forsed internment in prisonlike camps and so on.

That is an insane statement.
If people went to churches at the rate they say they go to church, all the churches would be packed. That isn't the case. Most "religious people" go to church fewer than 5 times a year then lie on surveys. 
Evidence to support your claim? I could counter that "non-religious people" go to church every day then lie on surveys.
You haven't been to the deep south have you 
Nope
That's a complete lie. 
Then why aren't the churches full? Only time I've been in a church in the last 6 years was for a funeral 
What's fuck has that got to do with anything? Why does it matter if they are full?   You said no one goes to church. Now you're asking why they are not completely full...?  Are you ok?     
Oh yeah because your personal experience IS A FACT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  Uneducated much? The murican classic.
The US was Britain's first penal colony before Australia.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony#British_Empire
##Penal colony A penal colony is a settlement used to exile prisoners and separate them from the general population by placing them in a remote location, often an island or distant colonial territory. Although the term can be used to refer to a correctional facility located in a remote location it is more commonly used to refer to communities of prisoners overseen by wardens or governors having absolute authority.  Historically penal colonies have often been used for penal labour in an economically underdeveloped part of a state's (usually colonial) territories, and on a far larger scale than a prison farm. In practice such penal colonies may be little more than slave communities.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Scotland/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove

The most successful ones in the nation? Pretty sure they get the highest average SAT scores, and all the old Ivy leagues are there.
Only 4 of the 8 are there. SAT scores are typically influenced heavily by wealth and this is one of the wealthiest locations in the nation. It also has one of the lowest rates of minorities in the nation, and minorities tend to do worse on the SATs.
Please. They lead the nation in every positive category and drag the rest of the nation forward. They fund your stupid part of the country. 
>ree they lead the nation in things I like 
Employment, education, living standards, life expectancy, not sucking on the federal teat as much as the rest of the country...I guess you don't like any of that.
Education is just a factor of wealth and property taxes and I don't think any of these numbers are much higher for New England than they are for the mid Atlantic states. If they are it is a function of New England having fewer minorities than the mid Atlantic states.   Also most of the "sucking the federal teat" red states do is from farm subsidies. 
 >New England than they are for the mid Atlantic states  I'm from PA myself. I wasn't shitting on the mid-Atlantic; it's not nearly as bad there as the South, though the "T" in PA is pretty much Alabama.  >Also most of the "sucking the federal teat" red states do is from farm subsidies.   Doesn't matter what the fuck they waste it on; it's still my money.

If American wasn't a better life, why do so many Mexicans wanna come here?
Because your government oppressed them in their own country by buying their exports at the lowest possible prices. Then they created a drug war of which Mexico is the biggest casualty despite Americans tremendous consumption of illicit substances that generally arrive via the Mexican border from many central and South American nations.

Boak.
I wonder if Ruth will have the guts to voice her real opinions of the DUP though.
Scotland, you weird 
My constituency was the only fucking one in the Aberdeen area that never voted Tory.  The fact she'd rather go to the DUP shows her viewpoint on Scotland, stuck up mongo cunt
Since Begbie was the cunt who glassed the bird, I'm assuming that you yourself voted Tory, but don't want to admit to it, and prefer to stir shit instead of owning up to your own awful, awful behaviour?

Hi, I'm an ignorant American from r/All, representing other ignorant Americans. Could somebody the lot of us in on the political climate in Scotland?

Can you not peddle the ignorant American trope please? We're trying to claw back up post our last election
Well, I'm American, I'm ignorant to what the situation in Scotland is like. There's no shame in admiting one's ignorance if you're trying to better yourself, or increase your understanding of what you're ignorant of.   What is shameful is letting ego get in the way of learning something new, which i think is the real issue behind the ignorant America trope. 
fuck snp and fuck scottish people

I'm hard (very hard in fact) but not a dick. I do have a dick though, a big one - it's also hard (very hard in fact).
You're one disturbin' bloke it has ti be said.
Ask yer bird, she'll let you know how disturbin' he was.

Never heard of it. Two distilleries and a nice wee railway station, though, might take a visit one day.
One working distillery and one moth-balled distillery which is basically on the same site as the working distillery.
Literally the only reason I know that town was that english fella doin the football scores on Grandstand. "Forres Mechanics, SIX (upward inflection), Brora Rangers, one."  Miss that on a saturday afternoon.

Right here mate.
Long live Scotland! This Mexican loves you all so much!!!
You're all English.  Edit: sorry, that was a bit insensitive. You're all English only more drunk, more depressed and overly obsessed with sheep. Worse than Wales you are.
Naw we urny, get tae fuck ya dobber. Yer sister's a slag and yer maw punts cooncil.

As an American, make me do something. Please show me just how much influence you actually have over me. Flex those mighty military muscles and impose yourselves upon us...    Oh that's right you're actually just a wee internet fucking dobber who cannae get a ride. Your country's achievements aren't your achievements. You've got squat pal, so bite ma banger and remember, you'll never get as many American burds as I did with this accent ;) ooft thirsty thirsty.
You're a pure unit mate.
Haha get tae fuck you cooncil-puntin raj
Your country is sliding into irrelevance you cross-eyed prick. Either that or civil war it's hard to tell
As an American I humbly petition the Scots to forgive us for all the dumb cunts threatening to have their decrepit Da bitch slap the world with his wee carroty hands. Most of us dinna elect that bawbag grifter, but these shite for brains canna empty their wallets fast enough to build some half-arsed wall that won't stop any numpty with a ladder. We are up to our tits in stupid twatwaffles at the moment, but rest easy that the stupid fuckers canna use a map without their  crayons. No doubt we'll invade Greenland and be trounced by Muslim polar bears at this rate.
Scotland is savage af
Aye
You guys seem like a fun bunch. I just wish I could understand what you guys say.  One word just throws me off.  I love you though.
Just assume it's an affectionate threat of violence and you'll be right 90% of the time.
Best tourist advice for Scotland I've ever seen.
Tourist board should sign him up
Exactly. Being called a cunt in Scotland can be a complement. Even "he's a right daft cunt him" can be positive. Ye canny beat the banter!
Don't worry, many of us are playing it up for effect.  I sometimes find the whole writing in dialect and playing to stereotypes thing annoying, but some people like it.
Oh they'll get the usual welcome...
Every American who supports the President isn't from the_donald...
Aye but they aren't here.
How do you know that?
Scots can see the future. Even your Donald's maw. She knew he'd be a cunt and that is why she fucked off tae have him elsewhere.
Marry me. 
Luckily as I am a Scot I can see the future, yer already happily married to /u/Orsenfelt with 3 lovely ginger weans and one shaggy dug.
My mom's a ginger! Maybe we'll have a bunch of ginger babies. 
Did ye no read what I said? You have 3 ginger weans. I can see the future, mind. 
But they *are* all pretty fucking stupid, so I think the advice still stands.
You're getting played by the media 
Says the cunt who reads the wibbling of the alt right and believes it. I sir do not trust your critical faculties, and am of the opinion that yer maw would have been better off keeping the afterbirth instead of you. 
Holy shit. Y'all are really good at telling shitheads to fuck off.   We need more of this. 
Its our national pastime. Honestly ripping the cunt out each other is all we do all day long. So when we get the chance to turn it on Trump-supporting yanks we're ready to go.

Aye, somebody noticing you is all you ever wanted, ya wank. How about cultivating a talent instead?
Jesus Christ. I have to believe some of this language has to be playing off Scottish stereotypes and used sarcastically, but wow this is exactly how imagined a Scottish sub would look like.

Funny how anyone who doesn't want to put up with their bullshit is "censoring" them. They think everyone has a moral imperative to pay attention to them.

I'm sorry but your patter has been removed for being utter shite.  Oh and cos you're a 'cuck' user.
I love you Scottish bastards! Thanks for helping with the cause! Also words can be confusing, it's best to just use pictures with these guys. 
Love it when Americans try and join in banter with the Scots. Or Brits in general. Or Irish. Or Australians. Or anywhere really. Always get so badly mugged off.
I dunno, I have lived in Scotland for a number of years and I can get into it with the best of them.  Not to mention, the Irish tend to have a good try too (try)  edit: I'm an Aussie.   
I interpreted that is him saying us Aussies, brits and Irish are all tops at banter and its funny when Americans try to join in.
This is why this is my favorite sub on Reddit.   I love you, Scotland <3
Fucking liar, you're pandering for karma. I bet you're American. 
I am American, but I'm not pandering--I do love Scotland. Always have.  Don't hate me because I love you. :(
It's alright, you can love us because we hate you. :)

Yep, we're retarded, and yet it worked. We even triggered the CEO of Reddit. Top fucking KEK, m8.
Aye it well makes people listen to your logical argument. Fuck at least the Nazis put in the effort.
Our intention isn't to convince you.  Our intention is to challenge your worldview. To make you realize that other opinions exist. Sometimes you can't ignore them.  Oh, and you called me a Nazi. I almost forgot that part because it goes in one ear and out the other. It's like me calling you a Stalinist. Doesn't do much. It has to stick, brother.

I know it was fun at first, getting all the lefties apoplectic, but it's gone a long way too far.  It's time you lot grew the fuck up, and started taking the world seriously.  It's not a game.  It's not a reality show.  It's not some kind of 4Chan LARP.  
Oh, but it *is*, my good sire.   4Chan LARP sounds amazing. Put on some Shadilay and hand me a foam battle axe, I'm ready to sperg out and  wreck some shit
Someday, years from now, you're going to look back on what you've been involved with here, and you're going to feel deeply ashamed of yourself.    I just hope Cheeto Hitler manages to screw you and your loved ones over in a YUGE way before he's finally toppled.  
Ah, yes. If only I was on the right side of history and wished harm against families like you...   Go fuck yourself, hypocrite. 
I don't know you personally, no. You might be warm and welcoming. Unfortunately, if you voted for Trump you voted for someone who is neither warm, nor welcoming.
I view him as warm and welcoming.  Putting a temporary lockdown on 7 countries that are experiencing crisis and conflict (many of which are currently engaged in combat with) seems to be the common sense thing to do to protect your citizens, especially after the threats of infiltration.  We are at war. As much as people want to ignore that fact, it's the truth.  
Who are you at war with? Desperate and penniless people from some of the poorest corners of the globe, who have collectively killed nobody on American soil? Against the biggest military in world history?   Some brass neck on you lads.
I view him a a blustering demagogue, whose own ridiculous populist policy is being ripped to shreds by judges up and down the land.   Even if you think the motivation behind them is good (and it may well be), you can't possibly think he's gone about it the right way.  
I think he's effective. He's a wrecking ball, but it's quite effective so far.
Effective at what, exactly? "Clearing the swamp", by stuffing his government with his friends and family? 
If there was a room of people you didn't like and you wanted them to leave that room, what would you do?  I was perfectly fine with throwing a bag of shit and piss in the room with them.  Sure, there's shit all over the walls, but that'll wipe off with a towel.

You're well within your right to do so. I have no right to step foot in your country without permission.
>We are at war.  Have you informed Congress?  How many attacks in the US have been perpetrated by people from those countries in the past decade?
> Have you informed Congress?  Ha, you're cute. When was the last time we did that? Probably before I was born.
And yet your own constitution states that the power to declare war resides solely with them.  You've also not answered my second question.
>And yet your own constitution states that the power to declare war resides solely with them.  It sure does. It still doesn't stop my warmongering government from doing it anyway. It also doesn't matter, we're at war even if we don't declare it. ISIS doesn't care that we don't want to fight. They're bringing a fight anyway.  >You've also not answered my second question. How many attacks in the US have been perpetrated by people from those countries in the past decade?  San Bernardino shooting, Orlando shooting, Boston bombing, New York bombing, Texas art gallery shooting, Tennessee Military Recruiting Office shooting, etc, etc.  The biggest reasons and attacks were in Europe though. We don't want that to happen here.
So like 2003, or...?
>On December 8, 1941, Congress approved a resolution declaring war with Japan. The Senate unanimously approved the resolution, 82-0.

Yeah, well fucking done. 
I wasnae running pal.
Hi I am from the Donald so what's this protest going to solve. I am sure Trump is going to hear about this a resign. 
Coming from a country with such a proud history of demonstrations, maybe you should read up on some history. 
I'm just amazed that a third-rate colony like Scotland has the wireless infrastructure required to host one of these Instagram protests! way to go, guys! :D
It's quite hilarious that the States originated as an actual colony and Scotland has never been one, despite Renton's assertion in Trainspotting. Though I don't know what's more amusing, that you think it is one or forget that you were one.
wireless infrastructure?  who needs that shite, i'm posting here from a bit of square slice sellotaped to a mince round.
I heard ye get a better signal if ye use a Killie pie instead of a mince round, but I've yet tae try.
American here. You Scots are good people. You brew some delicious beer, your dialect is (from a linguistics student's perspective) fucking fascinating, and your protest signs are a delight.  You guys keep it up, and I just might have to visit, drink too much, and vomit on some of your fine city streets.

> your dialect is (from a linguistics student's perspective) fucking fascinating  You better not have just referred to Scots as a mere dialect mate, I'll have you know that it is a legitimate, distinct language™.
IIRC Scots was a distinct language descendant from Middle English, and that Scottish English was the dialect. So like that sign is (pure class) the dialect, and Burns (also pure class) would be Scots.
[deleted]
I don't know if by Scottish, you mean Scots or Scottish English, but in either case, you're right in a way.  In the case of Scots, you're more likely to see the Gaelic and Old Norse words preserved, but the roots are from Middle English.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language  With Scottish English (the dialect of Modern English) you're less likely to see those Gaelic and Norse to influences, because this is the development of Modern English, spoken in Scotland.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English  Both articles seem to suggest a spectral continuum between the two languages (which I was unaware of being part of this narrative) but essentially they both develop from different points historically and this is the main reason for the differences between the two.
Best way to look at it is if Scotland and England were two separate countries then would we be speaking the same language? I don't think we would. Just as close neighbours around the world have very close yet distinct languages.
[deleted]
The area within which Middle English dialects would have been spoken (as well as Later Old English dialects) would have extended up to the Lowlands, and for continuous time. This is the reason for the development of Scots in that region, but the political border of Scotland and England is why it's called "Scots" and not "English". There is some Middle English preserved in Scots and even Scottish English that mainstream Modern English has abandoned.  Take the use of the word "bairn", which was from Middle English "barn, bern". If I'm not mistaken, it's used in both Scotland and Northern parts of England. The word is Norse in origin and it's frequency in English speakers would correspond to the Danelaw area.  This is also why they probably watch more BBC Alba in the Highlands, since Gaelic had reign in that region up until, say, the Clearances.
In the purest definition, yeah it's a dialect.   From the perspective of a person who's tried to read Scot's English, you're fucking right it's a distinct language. Trying to decipher a Scottish blog post was the hardest thing I had to do all semester in my linguistics class.
Scottish English and Scots are indeed separate things, the former being a dialect and the latter a language. The line between the two can be blurry though.  I was just being an arse though, I don't really expect people to know or care about the distinction haha.
I wasn't aware. Shouldn't be much of a surprise though, seeing as I only studied linguistics for a semester.
You'll hear the term "Scots' Gaelic" used in Ireland to refer to your flavour. Just to keep things confusing.
You realise they were referring to Scots and not Scottish English, right?   I would agree with the other comment that the sign is in Scottish English but the one you're replying to was referring to Scots.
Guess he's a newish linguistics student
Here, you seem sound. You're welcome to come over an pump ma maw anytime big yin. 
That sounds delightful. I'll start applying for my passport right away.
What's a roaster?
A nice chicken you throw in the oven.
Whatever you need it to mean. When talking about Trump, it means "bellend".  When talking about yur mate who cannae down his pint in a oner, it means "Acht well ye gave it yur best shot, yur still a fanny but I'm stuck with ye."
A fool, somebody who says things that are so stupid you deserve abuse.

Welcome any time!   Unless you're ginger.. we have enough ginger people.
Certainly not.   Now if Trump wanted to build a wall to keep the gingers out....
The ginger people can speak to wild Haggis though, and ride them... Those tame beasts. Haggis are known for their leaping abilities so they could easily jump that wall...   The heat down there would kill a ginger though. They'd literally be reduced to a pile of carbon..

That protest seemed pretty big, didnt know it was going on just happened to be out on the street cuz of the power cut and a fair lot of folk went marchin past.  Square seems a lot more quiet for the now but lot o folk yelling  *"Donald Trump Can Get Tae Fuck"* 
Aye, I had no idea. Just out of nowhere: protest.   Apparently the one in Edinburgh was bigger too. 
Well i was just standin talkin to a guy about the power going back on and BOOM! Loads of folk marchin down from mandela. Look over to the sqaure and even more folk, apparently was a fair few up by the steps of the concert hall as well.
Edinburgh was a few 1000 can't give you any more accurate than that I'm terrible at judging crowd numbers.
Saw an estimate as high as 5000, but somewhere 3-5 seems likely. Fair turnout at short notice I think. Especially as there seems to be one in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee so people haven't just combined to make one Scotland-wide march.
Someone just posted a video of St Andrews too.
Their maws let them out?  Edit: [Fair play to the cunts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3cSmdCWAAE0L64.jpg:large)
The cunt that ran oot a ink on the No Ban, No Wall sign lol.  Defo used his maws bingo pens, rookie mistake.
Not surprising, it's like 40% Yank, 30% English posho, 29.999% golfer and one green keeper called Sandy.
Another excellent placard in display.
It was as far as the eye could see. I'd estimate 400,000 give or take a few.
Probably the largest crowd ever, both in person and around the world. 
It was a good crowd, people say that. I think it was the best crowd, I do. 
We know protests, we have the best protests.
As an American (sorry for intruding) I'm going to pretend that it's more funny than sad that I thought your comment was unrealistically articulate for my president's oratorical style...
And the sun shone on them.
Only in Scotland would someone legitimately write, Just out of nowhere: protest.  lol
Was at the Edinburgh one, it was fuckin' huge especially for being so short notice. At least four thousand.
Attention Trump loving Septics! Most of R/Scotland is currently asleep. Please return after 9AM GMT when we will be happy to continue ripping the pish out of you and your tiny handed Numbnut in Chief.

You'll have to check what time it is in Moscow, as that is the only time zone these guys know.
It is after 9AM now lads, fire away.

Wrong Celts.
Acting as if Trump supporters aren't absolutely the sheep shaggers of America. 
Like trump supporters would shag sheep please they have horses and their sisters/cousins 
Hey now, us Aberdonians also reside in Scotland ya know. The Welsh don't have a monopoly on sheep shagging. 
Excuse me, if I do that, then how will I rear the next generation of sheeple for you to yell at to wake up?  You're not thinking this through, hen.

How many boxes do you have left to tick? Actually, don't know why I'm asking because I don't think you can count - you don't even know what language you're using.

Can't write a basic shell script, you're not willing to run your shitty code in a prod environment, and you can't even get a simple filename in your comments correct.  Your use of `open` means you're either a Mac user or can't use UNIX systems properly, and you probably aren't comfortable with command line editors like Vim, Emacs or even Nano - no need to use a GUI editor for such a short script.  The 'decoded' string is full of the usual lazy cliches you lot parp out. Not to mention it uses a constructor function (or maybe you just suck at code convention). Converting to a string is also either unnecessary, or should be part of your `Englishify` method.  You code like you insult, would not hire. 
Hm...not very polite.  But you're absolutely right, and he's got it fucking coming.  A solid 10/10 from the American.  (And, admit it: you're fucking *enjoying* telling people off.)

I'm already thinking up clever signs that I'll get past the censors.

Yes.
I got slapped for calling a girl from Troon a melon a while back.
Try callin them a spoon fae Troon. They canny deny that
As a random American visiting from /r/all, I actually have no idea what any of this means.  Or like 20% of the words used in this thread.  What's a roaster? What's Troon? Tae? steamer?   I'm so confused...  But I appreciate the sentiment of the thread!
Tae = to  Troon = is a town in Ayrshire on the West coast of Scotland. It's quite nice.  Roaster= general insult.  Steamer= a drunk person.
Is Troon actually decent? I always imagined it to be like New Cumnock.
Yeah it's alright. Nice beach, few nice cafe's, pubs and restaurants and the golf courses if that's your thing.

It could never be fried because we all loved fried stuff
Fricasseed. 
Here's a wee list of regular words we use at an insult:  Roaster, Steamer, Melter, Weapon, Toilet, Cabbage, Whopper, Nugget, Rocket.   All of the above could quite easily follow: "Get tae fuck ya fuckin _______"
Tube an' 'aw!   Then there's all the more unique insults:   Jobbie (or is it Jobby?),  bawbag, fanny, arsepiece, shite, dobber, bampot, glaikit basturt, wallaper, scrote and plenty more. Ya jobbie nozzles. 
Personally I love the abruptness of "ya fud".  Or the anatomical mystery of "fannybaws"
I was once called an arseling by a drunken Fifer which I've loved ever since
Tool, Mellon, Neep, Tattie, Midden
Okay this confirms it. I came I here from r/all and I've been greatly entertained to the point where I about died snickering at the words and expressions in this thread but you just revealed what I suspected all along -  you're just making up words as you go, right?  
Naw, we're no puttin ye oan ya clarty wee midden, we aw ken whit we're on aboot. Aw the local insults are in a guddle tho' an' we're pullin' oot some auld classics an' aw. 
Pretty much yea, it is more the tone of voice you use rather than the words themselves so you can pretty much use anything as an insult if delivered properly.
Yer maws a boiler,  has a nice ring to it

I might be real outta the loop here, but other countries are picketing against Trump? Is he really that hated?
The day after Trumps inauguration, there were protests everywhere for the Women's March against him. Literally all over the world. Just reading off the Wikipedia page, there were at least 500k protesting in Washington, and an estimated 4.8 /MILLION/ protesting all around the globe. 408 marches in the U.S., and 161 in 81 other countries. 
[He's was less popular than Putin in the UK 6 months ago](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/17056/Favourability%20-%20international%20politicians%20v2-01.png) and his recent shenanigans haven't endeared him to many. Mrs. May is just about the only one of our politicians who hasn't spoken out against him.  [source](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/15/theresa-may-more-popular-jeremy-corbyn-among-tradi/)
For us Scots, it is kind of personal.   *Fucking golf course.*/mumblegrumble
It's happening all over the world my friend, it's not exclusive to Scotland.  Trump is a danger to everyone.
You should really look at some international news, there are protests all over the world. 
Well as others have said, it's happening a lot of places.  But here in Scotland we have a particular dislike of Trump as we have been having a feud with him for quite a few years now.
[Protests in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/31/time-to-take-a-stand-thousands-across-uk-protest-at-trump-policy)
We have been hating him for a long time already. Combined with his State Visit to the UK.
We were hating him before it was cool.
We've had a bit of beef with him for a while now
Yeah. Coz Trump is stupid. All of his supporters are stupid racist fucks.
Right?
Was a bit uncomfortable that Trump and I shared the distinction of having Scottish immigrant mothers, but it's good to see my mum's hometown is just as unhappy as I am.
My husband's family are mostly from the same island as his mum and the generally feeling when I was up there (when we briefly spoke about it) for Hogmanay was nobody really wants to discuss him. I guess if nothing else so that any relations still there don't get unfairly thrust into the spotlight.
Protests also in Edinburgh, Dundee,  and Aberdeen (**and** St Andrew's so that confirms  it must be serious :D)
There was even one in [Orkney](https://www.facebook.com/radioorkney/photos/a.222229797167.114824.31395967167/10153644283357168/?type=3&theater).
There were about 50 people in Inverness as well.

"Scotland people think right"   Fucking right we do
PEOPLE KNOW US  "Scotland, well, fuck."
American here. Scotsmen, please come to the States and do your thing. The Romans couldn't handle you, and we need to bring another militaristic authoritarian empire to heel.  I will provide you with as much whisky, tea cakes and cullen skink as you can handle, as a token of my gratitude.
Here that sounds no bad actually.  /u/HailSatanLoveHaggis fancy saving the downtrodden and marching over a different border?  I think we'll need tae swing by Ireland for a boat first but.

**BASH**

**S*LAD**
I mean, they technically count as English right?
Better not let them hear you say that..
The Romans? There're more modern examples, such as the legendary [Smeato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smeaton_(born_1976) who punched a burning terrorist at Glasgow airport.
> It was reported that Smeaton shouted "fuckin' mon, then" and aimed a kick in the testicles at Kafeel Ahmed, who later died from his 90% burns following the attack.  Holy shit that's great.
Kicked him in the balls so hard he broke his foot.
Different guy, not Smeaton. They're often confused. I think it's cause people can't fathom that there were multiple people up for smashing a burning terrorist. 
You sure? Might have been two I'm not doubting that but I was sure it was Smeaton that did his foot in
Definitely - the guy on the front page of the Record, the one who did his foot in, was called [Alex McIlveen](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/jeremy-clarkson-hails-glasgow-airport-9662053).   Smeaton was more memorable, so I think their stories got mashed together. 
Ah fuck yeah, I remember now, I got them mixed up. 
[And led to an amazing magazine cover](http://i.imgur.com/lsojHFq.png)
that shit you frame, hand over to your kids and have engraved on your tombstone 
[Billy Connolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gMJBQoHJ4E)
> It was reported that Smeaton shouted "fuckin' mon, then"  The terrorist's bottle must have crashed heavy at that point. You're on fire giving it all the "Allah Akbars" expecting people to be fleeing in fear, yet a baggage handler fresh off a snout break is heading towards you shouting "Fuckin mon then!". Cunt must have been terrified! 
Just to clarify, the burns were caused by a fire, not the skelp Steamo dealt him.
Fucking legendary
That warms my heart.
I mean the sentiment is good, and it's welcome and all, but there's some tension over our overly politicised teacake industry. [I'm not kidding believe it or not](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/04/storm-in-a-teacake-scottish-nationalists-call-for-boycott-of-tunnocks) 
f*****g secret teacake eaters
Probably with s***D. Cunts. 
Whoa. Seems like an odd choice, de-Scotifying that way.   The my grandma still flies the Scottish flag when we go to folk music festivals here in the States. Funny how the actually-Scottish tea cake people gave up the symbolic Scottishness before my old grandma.
I was in DC last summer for a few days and definitely wouldn't mind going back there, just not sure if you want any of us to head en masse to Washington DC and go 'sort it out'... [The last time anybody from our island did that, it didn't go too well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington).   Mind you, it depends whether the English approve of what Scots get up to whether we're referred to as British or not! (i.e. Sir Andy Murray wins at Tennis = British; loses = Scottish!)  EDIT - btw it was awkward as hell going on the tour of the library of congress/capitol building and being told a 15 minute tale about the British destroying it all... luckily the tour guide mistook our accents for dutch!
Suppose we'll have to give the English a ring and ask if they want to start up British Empire III with us.
[deleted]
The second British Empire was post-1776. The largest empire of all time - the one every one knows. 
THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!! 🎺🎺🎺🎺
🎺 🎺
At least you guys don't have to directly deal with him... haha...  nah but really it's cool to see other people out of the US respond to our shitty politics. it's very interesting.
US politics is big in Scotland for some reason. Maybe just cultural links or something? A lot of young people went to the US to campaign during the elections, one political party leader even went across.
I think it's more like 'For fuck sake let's no get as bad as they cunts eh?'  A sort of sick fascination, if you will.  So far it's gone no bad, we've had one independence drive wi nae deaths and nae tea mercilessly droont and we have a woman in the heed office with normal sized hands.
We have direct experience of Trump over the golf course and windfarm affairs. He is a total arsepiece. 
It's this. People were giving protesters a hard time for apparently protesting trump, but it's also to demonstrate to our shite leaders that we don't like people being racist cunts. Hence the US politics connection.
Maybe Cali and Scotland can join in the union of wankers who never get voting power for the decisions about themselves. We could even give you all the voting power, it would probably be a better situation than either you or us are in now.
San Diego here. You have my vote.
I think, especially for younger people, it's a combination of both recognising the influence that American politics has on the rest of the world (both through the direct impacts of their decisions and the tendency for American political trends to make their way across the pond) and using English-speaking social media and websites, which tend to be dominated by Americans.
For a long time before 2016, the orange cunt has been waving his bawsack in the face of Aberdeen - built a monstrosity of a golf course on protected land, then tried to cancel plans for a wind farm just off the shore  of said course. Fortunately, the Scottish government like renewable energy a lot, and told him to get fucked.   So he took it to the UK supreme court, who, unsurprisingly, also told him to get fucked.
There are a fair amount of people in the U.S. with Scottish ancestry. So it may be they have family in Scotland or something. 
Foreign interference in our elections isn't cool.
Bold statement from a Trumpet given his assistance from Russia to win the presidency. 
I was for Bernie, and am a liberal. I don't believe in the bullshit Russia theory, sorry.
I wanted Sanders to win myself. But the Russian stuff has at a minimum got some substance. 
lol what does that mean?
Well it's pretty obvious that the DNC hacking was released to Wikileaks to help undermine Clinton's campaign. And it seems more than likely that it was done by Russian state actors.   The Steele dossier that ended up being released has a ton of stuff which suggests that Trump was at best being guided by Russian intelligence. And the deaths of some Russian intelligence figures who could potentially be implicated in providing the stuff in that dossier since it came out is pretty corroborating imo. 
>released to help undermine Clinton's campaign  There's no proof of this being the case, and if Clinton was truly innocent it wouldn't have mattered anyways since they wouldn't have found anything damning.    >The Steele dossier  There also no proof of this being legitimate either, it's obvious propaganda.   Just because it was on the news doesn't make it true, how can you believe something that has no evidence to support it?
It's because Scotland sucks, they've never been able to gain their own independence, and everyone who was worth a shit immigrated to America (legally) centuries ago.
You should stick around and see how we deal with internal politics.
Our issues with Trump go back a *long* way before he decided to get involved in Politics. 
r/Scotland getting The_Donald treatment, was wondering when this would happen.  What a bunch of fucking morons they are. Reasonable supporters of the man may exist but they are not to be found there.
I dont fancy the Donald's chances much tbh. I mean it's not even a square go
They have guns. If they ever learn the right way to point them they might be dangerous to something other than themselves. 
People who support Trump are not reasonable people.
EDIT: Lol,I make a reasonable argument with sources, and I get banned. Y'all are pathetic.  Here's a reasonable argument that I've made that no one wants to address, so maybe you can help me out.  Not all immigrants are the same, and it's a fallacy to lump all immigrants from every nation together.   In our era, certain countries produce terrorists, and they spread their terror via immigration. Scottish and German immigrants(which is what Trump is made of) never committed mass crime. They weren't at war with the western world.   You can't say the about the countries trump banned from immigrating. 
> In our era, certain countries produce terrorists  Tim McVeigh, Terry Nichols, the Army of God, the Ku Klux Klan ... 
 >EDIT: Lol,I make a reasonable argument with sources, and I get banned. Y'all are pathetic.  Welcome to r/the_donald where you cunts do the same thing to anyone with a real argument. Go back to your safe space and suck your thumb troll. 
That's nowhere near a reasonable argument.  The vast majority of terrorist acts on US soil have not been comitted by citizens of the countries Trump has banned. Most of the attackers from 9/11 for example came from Saudi Arabia - but Trump has not included it, or any country he has private business in for that matter, in the ban.  Let's take Iran on the other hand. 95% *Shia* Muslim population, when was the last time you heard of a Shia Muslim committing terrorist acts in the West? Extremism in nowhere near common in any of the main sects of Islam, but it is *particularly* rare, almost non-existent, in Shia Islam.   This isn't keeping out terrorists. Instead, and we've already had so many reports of this since the ban was enacted, it is keeping out PhD students, scientists, mathematicians, doctors and workers who have literally built a life in the US based on hard work, and in some cases have lived there for decades. Literally the best immigrants coming into the country, and Trump has locked them out.  > and it's a fallacy to lump all immigrants from every nation together.  This is precisely what you are doing. You are assuming all Middle-Eastern countries are the same.  Trump is relying on you doing that, he has essentially banned a blanket group of Arab countries expecting you not to do any research on their current situation.  Even if we ignore the women and children running from warzones in Syria, why is Iran (an increasingly liberal state and valuable Western ally) on that list, while Egypt and SA are not?  
So you're just going to completely ignore the chaos in Europe right now? You're going to ignore the *entire* reason for the immigration ban? Nice try, but try harder.  >but Trump has not included it, or any country he has private business in for that matter, in the ban.  Ignorance. Trumps list of banned countries came straight from the Obama era Department of Homeland security. They made the list, Trump used that list. If you read that he didn't ban certain countries because of his business interests, you were reading fake news.   I agree though, that Saudis Arabia and Pakistan should have been on the list.  >Let's take Iran on the other hand.  Again, nice cherry pick. I don't know why Iran is on the list either. That doesn't mean that selectively banning immigration from countries based on the behavior of the immigrants relative to the host country is wrong.  >You are assuming all Middle-Eastern countries are the same.  No I'm not.
> nice cherry pick.  I was using Iran as an example for my points, so nice that you agree with me.   The truth however, is that not a single person has died on US soil from terrorists from any of these 7 countries since 9/11, and terrorists from those countries have only caused 7% of all attacks on US soil since then.  > Obama era   Don't hide behind Obama, Trump is president now.    > fake news.  That's hilarious and pathetic that you regurgitate anti-intellectual Republican buzzwords so easily. Regardless, here's a conservative source for what I've said:   http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/29/nations-hit-by-trump-travel-ban-have-produced-7-percent-of-muslim-terrorists-zero-fatalities/  > So you're just going to completely ignore the chaos in Europe right now  Mate, I'm currently studying *in* Europe right now. It's one of the nicest, safest and most welcoming places I've been to. Don't open your mouth about things you're uneducated about.  
You're still focusing on US terrorist attacks, which is totally off topic. The immigration ban is a proactive solution in response to European terrorist attacks. We are learning from y'alls mistakes.   >I'm currently studying in Europe right now. It's one of the nicest, safest and most welcoming places I've been to.

Depends on how you define Syria. The Islamic state of Iraq and Syria disagrees with you.
Scotland is more America than America right now.
We were even fighting the English hundreds of years before it was cool.
Except America won, you didn't. 
I didn't fight mate it was about 800 years ago.
Scotland won the Scottish wars of independence back in the 14th century then willingly joined the united kingdom hundreds of years later.   "Scotland was independent and remained thus, until the unification of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland to create the single Kingdom of Great Britain was completed in the Treaty of Union of 1707." 
What do you mean? Scotland wasn't trying to conquer England.
Trump supporters aren't so good with history. 
Its understandable that people from around the world aren't as well versed in Scottish history as someone born and raised in Scotland who learned Scottish history in school. Also perhaps instead of persecuting someone because of their beliefs you took time to educate yourself and others the world would be a better place. 
> Its understandable that people from around the world aren't as well versed in Scottish history as someone born and raised in Scotland who learned Scottish history in school.  Aye, perhaps but when you come here spouting absolute pish be prepared to get called out on it. Or, here is another contentious thought: Don't talk about what you've no fucking clue about.   > Except America won, you didn't.  Implies he knows about Scottish history (we lost) when he hasn't a fucking clue (we didn't)
That is correct Scotland wasn't trying to conquer England. An English king was trying to conquer Scotland. The English came up to Scotland staking their claims to the lands raiding, murdering and enslaving as they went until the Scots rose up against them. Using mostly guerrilla warfare tactics since they could not meet them head on in the field of battle, the English had large armies of well trained and well equipped soldiers not to mention their superior cavalry advantages, The Scottish armies were made up of mostly farmers using what ever weapons they could find.   Eventually under the leadership of Robert the Bruce and other brave defiant nobles of Scotland, the Scottish ran the english out of Scotland securing Scottish independence.   Years later another English king tried to conquer Scotland and again after a hard fought war the Scottish kept their independence.   "In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen. And won their freedom." A quote from a mostly historically inaccurate movie but still powerful words  
Then a Scottish king ascended to the throne of England lol. gg wp
I didn't think people private messaging OPs to complain was an actual thing until this thread lol  Like, report it or make a comment, why would I care about your private whining? 
goannae gie us a swatch of the belters?
"How many Americans do you think care? Not one American could name any Scottish politician ever in history."   That one was entitled "Truth Bomb" lol  
> How many Americans do you think care?  "There is at least 1 replying to me at the moment."
> Not one American could name any Scottish politician ever in history."  Like, most of their founding fathers... :P
Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh too. I'm sure they know who HE is
superb
Clearly you should have thought that... someone... would rile up a bunch of alt right cunts and get you thousands of karma so you'll take the hit on this one for trying to make us laugh.
r/The_Donald forgot the first rule of Scotland;  You can't out insult/argue a scot
Rule 2) definitely don't pick a fight with us. We can hold a grudge for centuries 
I'd call these Trump cunts snowflakes but they aren't beautiful or unique. Just the same, incorrect, comments over and over again about the difference between legal and illegal immigrants.   The Executive Order affects both, fucknuggets.
Dunno about "snowflakes" but they're definitely a bunch of fucking melts.
They don't have an original thought between them. They only know the 'party line' to repeat *ad nauseam* .      
They've nae patter. They should at least try and give us a laugh.
Saw a better one elsewhere - 2/3 wives are immigrants, doing the job Americans won't
Did anyone have a sign with "sprooter"? That is my new favourite word. 
What does sprooter mean?
"Sprouter", as in somethin that sprouts from the ground. In this banger's case, a geyser of Trump flavoured shite.
Oh I like that. Thanks!
Naw  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sprooter  It was on a post in /r/ScottishPeopleTwitter last week hence the popularity. 
That looks to me like an American has defined it. Fucktard isn't really that common here.  It's a word in Scots to mean gush anyway: http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/sproot  Which would stand to reason if they're slebbering shite.  I like my definition better.
aye that sounds about rite. Submitted a new definition to UD.
Doin' God's work.
*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***sprooter***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sprooter) :   ---  >An adjective.

Came from r/all this thread is great. The mods burning the trumpsters is funny as shit.  Fuck yea!
That's because you didn't just wake up to the mod queue ha.
Are you accepting refugees from America? I'm of Scottish descent. Lawyer, but a nice guy despite that. 
Coming from /r/all. Judging from this thread, Scots are some of the realist folks walking the Earth right now. Hopefully one day more mods of American subreddits will grow a pair like the ones here. 
We're very into speaking our minds as a people but are taught from birth that you call an arsehole an arsehole, and if it goes too far you shag his dad and get his mum to film it and put it on xhamster. Fon't be fooled though, there are plenty of bellends in Scotland just like anywhere else.
Fek off.  Too many lawyers already.
It's not my fault. I'd be happy to be something other than a lawyer in Scotland. 
You'd have to retrain in Scots law. You good at anyhin else?
Writing, computers, people, speaking with an authentic American accent
You should become a translator for Siri and other voice recognition that canny understand Scots accents. 
This is genius.
First he'd have to understand Scots accents though..

Well fuck, I thought we took that for granted  I like Talisker, Ardbeg, and Glenfiddich, among others  I welcome further education on this point
Aye, good luck to them gettin their heid around the whole "Not Proven" hing...
> fek  The fuck
Fill yer boots.
I'm not Scottish, but I drink and swear plenty.   
Everyone's welcome! 
Except Trump and co.
He doesn't drink.
Which is always suspicious as fuck. If you are an alcoholic and you've stopped, fair enough. But to have never even wanted to experience being cunted with your mates? Fucking sociopathic. 
I don't believe he has any mates...only sycophantic yes men/women he surrounds himself with. 
Almost makes you sympathetic. Almost.
Apparently it's because his brother was an alcoholic and died from it a while back.  Doesn't stop him being a raging cokehead though, among other things.
coke without booze just makes you into a fidgety arsehole though. i suppose it explains something.
How do the Scottish feel about weed? Too mellow, not enough fighting?
Used widely. Scots attitude towards pretty much every mind altering substance is "give it a go and see if you like it". 
It's not as popular here as in USA, but still quite widely used. You'll find that some people prefer to stick to party drugs (coke, mdma) instead, and they're much more popular here comparatively than anywhere else in Europe.
what mates? the man lives on top if a golden tower filled with his own employees 
On top of a golden tower, or under a golden shower, Trump is still a cunt.  But aye, fair point. 
Can I come to?  My dad was adopted so we can assume his parents were Scottish if that helps.
Same here. I'm of Scottish descent and I'm handy with computers. So uhh can I get a passport please? Haha. 
I can just hear Jack Jarvis shouting this.

Thats exactly wit its like
When someone says You instead of Ya in Scotland you know you've done something idiotic
Haw YOU
...aw fuck
I've nearly made it thirty years into my life without realising that. You're absolutely right haha.
What the fucks with all the Americans in here saying thanks.  Pull your fucking fingers out and get on with it yourselves for fuck sake.  I mean it's nice an all that your in here giving out compliments and all that but for fuck sake this is your fucking problem, get a fucking bend on eh.
We're turning into fucking Canadians!
You should they're good cunts them lot

Seems hilariously ironic that such bastions of self-esteem and unassailable egos are 'triggered' so much by us.   
Oh but they'll get us in the end with downvotes and racism I mean I know I'll be pure crying mysel to sleep tonight.
Tears of laughter maybe. I'm sat here wae a cup of tea waiting on the next idiotic comment rolling in.  Maybe we'll get a full on racist soon so we can break out the MacBanhammer
They probably haven't crawled out of their sisters bed yet.
>They probably haven't crawled out of their ~~sisters~~ daughters bed yet.  Ftfy 
Well, Trump does have links to Lewis...
American in Scotland here upvoting ALL the things! (except them of course).  I'm stocked up on whisky, aloe tissues, and Mars bars glad to share :)  
I'm afraid someone has reported you  >You'd fucking better!  I'm not sure if they mean you better upvote everything or share yer whisky and mars bars.
Not to worry.  I'm into upvoting and sharing :) 
Mars bars are fucking English! 
What if they're deep fried?
So long as its no a deep fried "believe" bar then it's alright in my book.
Well I mean you are currently having a anti-Trump circle jerk in a sub that has nothing to do with Trump.
The sub doesn't generally but the post does. He also has a shall we say chequered history in Scotland, so it's pretty relevant.
Shhhhhh.  Our friend here thinks that anything about Trump should only be posted on subs relating to him.  So, hopefully they'll realise that's only The_Donald and leave the rest of us alone
> in a sub that has nothing to do with Trump.  His mother was Scottish, he owns/operates businesses in Scotland, and he's instituted policies that are affecting Scottish people just now.  Where the fuck should we post? /r/nichesubsforspecificissues?  Fuck off, you absolute weapon.
Yep, and having a great time, too. 
Haha, the Donald are absolute hypocrites. They ban anyone at the slightest hint of dissent, but they all go running to their safe space when the same happens to them elsewhere. Small handed, orange cuck bassas.
They broke their own subreddit rule with that post  > No posts about being banned from other subreddits 
Those rules are only for show; they love to brigade. 
That would be in line with what I've observed.
Nice gloves cool guy
Love that this got reported for "insulting that mans gloves".

Globalization and the internet has brought an Italian-Brazilian Law student to a Scottish community to read about the United states president.   THANKS FOR BEING SO BLOODY AWESOME YOU BUNCH OF LUNATICS! Hard to keep on with faith with the world being what It is but you folks made a shitty day better. Keep It up Scotland.
Just when I thought I couldn't love Scotland any more this happens!!
Trumpettes nail their party's talking points better than any political party I've seen. Loyalty to the orange, wee hands prick over all things. When his prophets Bannon and Spicer speak they must obey and all dissent must be crushed. It's like Labour Students meets Scientology. 
I fucking love the Scottish.
TIL: Scottish people write with an accent.
It comes fae ower three hunner years o cultural colonialism by way o bein telt aff (or skelpt by teachers) as bairns fir speakin wrang and constantly being telt that wir ain leid isnae valid cos it isnae the way the English speak. Thankfully younger generations o bairns are growin up tae ken mair aboot Scots and its history, and ken that their ane leid is just as valid as onybody elses.   **English translation:**  *It comes from over three hundred years of cultural colonialism by way of being told off (or physically chastised by teachers) as children for "speaking incorrectly" and constantly being told that that our language isn't valid because It's not the way the English speak. Thankfully younger generations are growing up to know more about the Scots language and it's history, and knowing that their own language is just as valid as anybody elses.*   There's still large number of Scots with a chip on their shoulder about the language "only being a dialect" and they themselves propagate the idea of it making speakers look uneducated. In my opinion though, that's just the mindset of your average colonised Scot. Hopefully that'll be a falling number of people as the years go by.  Anyway, apologies for the half-cut rant. I'm off tae my bed.
I'm Scottish and I've got no bloody clue what leid is. Accent or summit'?  Edit: replied before reading your translation because I'm half cut.
It's at that interesting boundary between a language and a dialect. If i speak or write in Scots in England i have no chance of being understood yet officially it is just a dialect of English yet if I speak Slovak in Prague or Norwegian in Aarhus they'll probably understand what i'm saying yet Czech and Slovak; and Norwegian and Danish are separate languages.
It's a language called Scots go read the wiki and learn about it.
American here, can I come hang out with you guys? You seem like a good bunch.
Course mate
I love the way Scottish type/write so much. It makes it feel like theyre talking to you
Or drunk.
usualy drunk
I love that the **entire** world is in unison when they say fuck Trump but it's the libtards that are the ones living in their "special bubble"
I cannot stop laughing at this thread. Love you Scots. 
It's things like this that make me proud to be Scottish 
I love you guys. Your vulgarity and spelling habits are giving me strength. You should all visit New York City, I think you would fit right in. 
Been there, can confirm, fit in, got shit-faced and almost started a fight on a tour bus with a bunch of racist woman from the midwest that were rippin the pish out of the Asian lassie on the mic. Cunts. She was doin her best. FFS I could understand her, how could they no?  [edit: didn't start a fight, just had enough of their "ching chong" pish, turned round and shouted "**GONNAY SHUT THE FUCK UP**", and they shut the fuck up]
You gotta do what you gotta do. 
Been to New York and the next comment will surprise you I think. The people are absolutely lovely. And polite as fuck! 
Please don't refer to our indigenous languages as "spelling habits," cheers :-) 
Can barely understand it, but it's an insult. God I love Scots.
You're all legends. This thread is incredible. Thank you, from another American. 
Fuck off, Yank

Lol, nice. 
What a sad wee shite.  
Hahah, this centipede has "been fucking with them (the Scottish) for hours". Look at his history, he's literally wasted hours in here making low energy comments.   If you want to call this "fucking with them" go right ahead, but those are just alternative facts. Hahaha. 
America. 2017. Trump's ruthless quest to establish a authoritarian regime has his people at war with the world. The mobilization of armies in California and Washington prove no deterrent, as the Republicans invade their liberal neighbors to the west, and south. While extending their reach northward towards Canada's critical oil fields. By fall, the Republican lightning war to soften California is launched, Europe and Japan increase production, racing to aid the West Democrats. By 2018, the battle for the Midwest is on, as the Democratic Marines arrive in the Dakotas. On the Southern Front, an impatient Trump breaks his pact with the Texans. Greg Abbott responds with a Scorched Earth policy, intent on leaving only ruins for the Republican invaders, but one by one his cities fall. Now, in 2019, massive Republican Air Raids commence against Houston, and the battle for this noble city turns vicious. The Texan Army refuses to retreat. A Conservative-Democratic counter-offensive is launched against the Republican force, that now stretches from the Atlantic, to Canada, and deep into the American Midwest. Against impossible odds, millions come forward to answer the call. 
> Republicans invade their liberal neighbors to the west, and south.  Here's the thing:  You know how people are going on and on about the 'death of small town America', and how this is the *real* reason people voted for Trump?  Well, one of the hallmarks of that rural/small-town decline is a demographic drain, as over the last 20-30 years, more and more young people have moved away for education, and job opportunities.  Wanna guess where an awful lot of them ended up?  Truth is, a good share of these 'elites' used to be regular old farm kids.  They still know how to shoot.  So, in the event that anything like this happens, I don't think it'd be quite the cake-walk that the alt-right zoomers dream it would.       
can confirm, live in liberal southern city, everyone can shoot a gun. just because we think Trump is a waste of perfectly good atoms doesn't mean we forgot how to hunt. (except for me, apparently. I'm a godawful shot.)
(Another) American here: I love your country so god damn much.  I've been there 10 times and always want to go back.  Our government is going to do some shitty, awful, unforgivable things in the next few years.  Please don't hate all of us, most of us didn't want this and are fighting the new administration every step of the way.   
whats a roaster?  source: not scottish.
Someone making a complete and utter cunt of themselves. Or a testicle. Depends on the context. 
I've never heard of baws being called roasters, is that a real thing?
Aye man. "the baw hit him right in the roasters". 
Fair enough, never heard it before, but I'd know what you meant if you said that so it works.
As a Scot, who doesn't know every single Scottish slang word and curse. And nor could I, there is a lot... you need to understand that Scottish cursing and language in general is not as literal or as defined as typical English. Especially American English.   Just go by context. The meaning is not important, the intent is. I had never seen roaster before, maybe because it is Glasgow and I live in Edinburgh. *Who knows*. The intent is what matters and I was able to read this sign and know *exactly* what the guy meant. The meaning of the word is... inconsequential.   I mean, isn't that words, like in general? Does it really matter what we are *saying* or only what we *mean*. I am going to be honest with you, half the time I don't understand half of what people say around here. Probably because I am Scottish born but not Scottish bred if you know what I mean. I didn't have that immersion growing up except for the half I spend with nonfamily.   But that is okay because they don't understand me sometimes! Especially when we drink. Which I have not been doing but anyway. When my mates and I get *realllllllly* drunk I honestly stop understanding the *words* of half of them. The other half are good cunts.   Like I was saying, it doesn't matter though. Because I know what they *mean*. In their voices. Ignore the words pal and focus on the message. The words are just shite. Little details. I don't know how to type squeaking noises but that is what they are. Squeak!   If you want to make it here, don't look at the sign and think, "what does that mean?". Think, "what is it saying." That is how I survive here. That and I only ever mention the Irish mother and never the English father.   So what does roaster mean? Who fucking knows or cares. What does it say!   It says fuck off Trump, you yellow, cheeto dicked, fascist, homedestroying, hypocritical, golf course building, wall dreaming, racist, misogynistic, greasy, egotistical, narcy cunt.   Or alternatively, *a roaster*.   :)   
have an upvote.

This makes me proud to be dating a Glaswegian man. Also, this sub is my favourite. I live halfway across the world so at least I can pretend to be with my guy in Scotland when I read this. Plus you are all hilarious and this is one of the reasons why Scotland is the greatest country in the world, ever.
> Plus you are all hilarious  I'm not.
First time I've agreed with you. 
And if I *was* funny I could come back with a witty retort...  instead I'll have to make do with **cheers ex-moose fucker**.
> ex-moose fucker.  Lets be honest, he probably still dabbles. 
You probably are.
I suppose it all depends on your definition of the word *funny*, judging by the amount of children who tug at their parents sleeve and say "look at that funny man" then I guess I may well be hilarious in my own special way.
Aye no funny as in haha funny as in odd.
I know what I'm reading after my 10:30 meeting 
I mean, I used to say he didn't hate immigrants, just illegal immigration, but now I'm not so sure...
To be fair he's not the first President to do this, he's not even the first President to do this to muslim countries.  It's odd that this caused more outrage than Obama going after primary schools and civilians with drone attacks.
It's a lot more blunt. Stabbing someone in the back makes less noise than trying to run them over with a monster truck.
I may not understand what was written 100% but I still had a good laugh. (I'm not scotish)
Go Scotland. 
Could one of you guys tell me what a roaster is? Sounds like something you cook a pot roast in but since that ain't to insulting I am doubting it. Or you called him a crocpot, I'm not sure.

Retard - delay or hold back in terms of progress or development.  Imo thats a pretty accurate term to describe the majority of people in this thread.

Totally haha. I didn't even notice until now haha sorry
No worries, there's a lot of wrong 'uns in this thread, it is quite difficult to work out who's just here ripping the pish and who's genuinely a turd floating in the gene pool.
> a turd floating in the gene pool.  Haha 
Why are they protesting in Scotland?
Don't want a Trump state visit, I think. Also just generally letting our governments know that they don't like him or his politics. Seems a reasonable enough reason to protest to me. 
it seems reasonable to protest far-right politics wherever they occur. people I know in Ireland were more pro-Trump than my conservative American friends, and that terrifies me.
Jaysus, being from Ireland I've yet to come across a Trump supporter.
He's big among Orangemen I hear 
Fair enough on the State visit, but given you have Theresa May you have more pressing things to protest about.   Or just declare independence really.
You won't get a state visit because  Scotland is only a pretend country. Don't worry about it you sucker of English dicks.
Said the guy sucking a tic tac.
[Yeah cos if there's anything Scotland's known for it's doing England's bidding.](http://i.imgur.com/Ed4LdEW.jpg)
You seem like a knowledgeable guy!  It's so hard to tell if any of you people are real or just products of some sort of algorithm that produces comments guaranteed to be equally ignorant and bigoted.
Ignoring the london cunts alot of us english love our northern neighbours so dont try and stir shite, we do that well enough on our own 
Assuming you're a Trump supporter, why don't you tell the glorious orange leader that his maw sucks English dicks?
One of his many conflicts of interests is in Aberdeenshire.
....and Ayrshire (Turnberry)
The leader of one of one the most powerful countries in the world, a country which is culturally, politically and economically connected to ours, is a bigoted cunt. Of course we should fucking protest
US politics have an effect on pretty much the whole world. 
But what do you think protesting about it in a foreign country is going to accomplish. He basically doesn't care what foreign governments think of him.
Aye but our government might care what we think and change their policies towards him as a result
Do it. I dare you.
The centipede minds are regressing rapidly. How old are you, 13?
Do what?   Change our policies towards him? In Scotland? So be welcoming and block the windfarms that he's always greeting about? Na, we'll continue telling him to fucking beat it. 
Because we want him to know the entire world thinks he's an old jizz stain on the bed sheet of the world.
And let's not pretend that the Irish didn't create some ruckus while assimilating. Net gain is something actually businessmen understand. This dude is a fucking shill. Harness new talent you fucking idiot.

Appreciate the support but best to keep mention of that film internal or you'll end up with rants about how inaccurate it was. Admittedly, probably just from me. But they ruined some great stories!

I like it, thanks!
You're welcome.  Most Scottish insults are either variations of cunt or question the sexual tastes of yourself or of your family members, sometimes in combination.
Either that or question a family member's occupation.   "Yer sister's a welder"   "Yer maw punts cooncil" (your mother sells poor quality cocaine)
My maw was a legal immigrant
Just like the ones stuck at the airports right now?  edit: *ones
Aye and yer da sells avon.
Like that matters. Still would be stuck from home and work from this ban. 
and she punts cooncil. 
Why are people protesting Trump in Scottland lol?  
Cos hes a cunto  Cause hes had scraps with Scotland and even our FM for years and has fucked over loads of people in aberdeenshire.   Tried to sue the Scottish government for putting up wind turbines 😂 fucking roast
Cunto, my favorite Mexican cheese
Soon to be 20% more expensive 
He's been acting like a cunt in Scotland for years. Safe to say that we hated him before the Americans did.  Oh, and the daft cunt built a wall around a guy's house and failed to get him to pay for it.
Because no doubt the media there has hyped Trump to be the end of the world
Eh, we have been against the Cheetolord since before he was elected President Cheetolord. He has history in Scotland.
Because there is absolutely nothing going on in Scotland. The world is obsessed with the U.S.

That's the reddit account of Trump's son! Roast the roaster's offspring (who are of an age to be roasted, leave wee Barron alone).
Sounds great, but am still American and I don't know what this means
He's being called a cunt. Or possibly a testicle.
Both, and a scrotum too.   Insults in Scots convey a general sense of loathing, they're not necessarily anatomically specific.
Scottish guy here who moved to America.   Do people not realize that Trump isn't banning immigration?  His mum was from Scotland, the USA still welcomes immigration from many countries.  What trumps executive order did was to put a 90 day hold on travel of people from the 7 'problem' nations, he requested that the DHS submit to him a valid and thorough vetting procedure for people from these nations to immigration could continue.   Now, I don't agree with the executive order however it drives me nuts that people conflate general immigration with this executive order.   Trumps mum wasn't from the 7 nations, in fact she was from the nation that is the closest ally to the USA. Immigrants coming from the UK have nothing to worry about, so this sign makes no sense.  If trumps mum were Sudanese or Iranian then it would be an apt thing to say. 
Brother, that ban included LEGAL VISA holders(H1B, student), and LEGAL Permanent Residents before the courts allowed green cards in.  So the LEGAL VISA holders are still banned.
Yes. From the 7 nations and until they can be sufficiently vetted.    The terrorist attacks that happened in Europe last year where performed by LEGAL immigrants from these nations. 
Yes, but the ORIGINAL announcement was for 30 days, and only mentioned refugees.  Then 24 or so hours later when the order was signed, it became 90 days and suddenly included LEGAL visa holders and lawful permanent residents. People who are not citizens, but passed tons of vetting.  I know I sound like a left blowhard, but I'm afraid things will slip again, maybe more nations will get added, and what if the 90 day thing become 180 days?  More than enough time to get fired or lose a semester, even though you did things legally, brother.
Unfortunately it's the world we live in when people from. Your country commit despicable acts.  As a non citizen you are allowed entry at the will of the government, you have no rights, you have a privilege which can be altered at any time. 
But at what point do we separate people from the country?  And even the H1b and students paid thousands in legal fees, tons of paperwork, multiple interviews to get the visa.  They pay taxes or tons of tution, some have mortgages and might get fired if they can't get back to their jobs.  And yes the aren't citizens but they did things legally the right way, and signed contract with the U.S. allowing them lawful exit and entry for the duration.   Yes it can be altered, but all of a sudden? This could have been handled much better.  Sorry for being preachy.
You separate people from their country when they denounce their citizenship.  I'm from the UK, I moved over here legally and I knew when I was a permanent resident that I was staying in the country at the will of the government.  When I became I citizen I denounced my UK citizenship and sent my passport back to them, at that point I am no longer a subject of the queen and I am a 100% free American citizen. 
> I am a 100% free American citizen  LOL
Freedumb!!
What are you so afraid of?
> From the 7 nations and until they can be sufficiently vetted.  As someone who immigrated to the states you must surely realise how much of a ballache it is to get a green card in the first place. What more vetting could a TSA troll do that the Immigration dept. hadn't already?
Plenty. According to the CIA vetting from these countries isn't sufficient which is why trump did what he did. 
You got a source on that? As far as we have seen, "these countries" haven't contributed to a single terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. Why they would only be considered a threat now is beyond me.
Not on American soil but they have perpetrated terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world most notably Europe.   
9/11 attackers were all Saudis and Saudi Arabia is the birthplace and incubator of Wahhabism, the "intellectual" basis of Islamist terror and yet, Saudi Arabia isn't banned...  So go boil ya heid ya bawbag
The raosn that Saudi Arabia is not banned is because they basically are in bed with the west. The US is not going o sour that relation.  It's not rocket science. 
Thirsty business all this.
Also a Scottish guy currently studying in America and the answer is people protesting this shit couldn't give less of a hoot what the facts are. They do it for the sense of community and as a social proof.
That's true. It's ironic they are protesting because people can't get into the country but I have colleagues and friends who have spent hours trying to get through airport security because these bell ends have created gridlock. 
They're bleating sheep that just want to make posts on their Snapchat stories roleplaying as 60s civil rights activists.  The messages protest signs are nearly always inaccurate, irrelevant, illogical or utterly vague. It makes me sad that *this* is what brings people out onto the streets back home.
Liberals are always looking for something to get triggered by

> half the population thinks its OK to behead someone for drawing a picture of their prophet.  You do realise that nobody has been killed on US soil by any of the countries he's banned since 2001.  He hasn't banned Pakistan, Saudi or Afghanistan where these ideologies started from, are funded from and have contributed to a considerable amount of deaths from...
Not to mention the hundreds of thousands thatve been killed in those countries as a result of American meddling
Do YOU realize that the choice of countries was from the Obama administration. But I get facts don't matter to your ilk. 
Do YOU realize that the Obama administration moved out of that building a week ago.   There was an announcement and everything.  But I get that your ilk don't like accepting responsibility for their own dumpster fires.  The buck stops with Trump.  He signed the paper.  
The list was to remove them from the visa waiver program, not ban them entirely.
> a country where half the population thinks its OK to behead someone for drawing a picture of their prophet  I was simply replying to this.
That's why it's not a "muslim ban".   P.S. Obama wrote-in those countries for a possible ban (hence why Iran is on the list).  Protest Trump by all means but for the right reasons.
> Protest Trump by all means but for the right reasons.  According to The_Donald posters like you, there is never a "right reason" to protest him.
> That's why it's not a "muslim ban".  Did I say that? Fucking hell, all you guys do is put words in peoples mouths.
Not you, only every media outlet. I don't know why you're so defensive about something you didn't say...
Probably just doesn't like when people spew a load of irrelevant pish in his direction.
You should tell that to Giuliani who's on record saying that Trump asked him how to do a Muslim ban. So while it may not be a Muslim ban officially there is no doubt in the mind of anyone that it targets Muslims specifically. And people who hide behind "it's not a Muslim ban" are the same type of mouth breathing wankers that say "Islam is not a race" . I mean sure they may be right, but it doesn't stop them being bigoted parasites.

Also:   > A 2008 amendment to the Nationality Law of 1952 designated 9 countries which are considered an enemy of Israel: Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen as well as the Hamas-administered Gaza Strip.  Did you do any research?
[deleted]
Fair enough, I just find it not terribly surprising that a county which Israel labels as an enemy state isn't going to let Israelis in. The current ban seems rather different to me, given that context.
Wow you mean Obama actually cut off immigration from a country we were at war with?! How dare he!

Why can't people understand the difference between illegal and legal immigration?? 
This is the most unique contribution to this thread.
The photograph is of a poster of a person stating that President Trumps mum is a Scottish immigrant.  Trump is wanting rid of illegal immigrants. That's the point.
*Woosh.*
Sooo why are people with green cards being left stranded then? 
Stranded where? President Trump is asking for people from high risk countries to be vetted. It's common sense and protecting the American people. 
Stranded in the country they were temporarily in when Dolan decided that them being legal immigrants was now no longer a good enough reason to allow them re-entry to the US.  So, tell me, who here is confused about the difference between legal and illegal immigrants? 
Legal immigrants are in a country legally, illegal are in a country illegally.  Trump has decided to bet all people entering the US from high alert countries to protect the citizens of the US. If you are clean you will get in after a vetting process. Please stop reading fake news and read real government policy .
So, the 5 year old **American Citizen** who was handcuffed and held for hours at an airport, by himself, because his mother was born in Iran, is illegal *how*???  You try fucking reading the news, you stupid cunt.
That is fake news unless you can provide proof kid .
[Proof](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/white-house-five-year-old-boy-detained-dulles-international-airport-hours-sean-spicer-pose-security-a7554521.html), kid.  Sooner or later, you're going to have to admit that this whole thing has been a massive shit-show, and that whatever the merits of the order as people like you keep imagining it was intended, the actual implementation has been so badly cocked up that it's gone far, far beyond that imagined intent.  Your boys done fucked up.  **ETA:** [This one's lovely, too.](http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/232856168-story).  All either citizens or perfectly legal and already heavily-vetted green card holders.  But hey, I can see how that elderly cancer patient might post a 'security threat'. You know, if you're a complete fucking paranoid, racist moron.  
Did you just some up the EU?
No, sweetie. Try to keep up:  We're talking about *The United States of America*.  That's the USA.  It's on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.  (Can you point to the Atlantic Ocean on your map?)  Donald Trump is the President of the USA.  The EU is the *European Union*.  It's on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. Donald Trump is **not** the President of the EU.  Donald Trump is making very poor choices for the USA.  He's not allowed to make any choices for the EU.  Now we've finished that lesson, let's move on to English!  Do you know what a *homophone* is?  A homophone is a word that *sounds* the same as another, different word.  The words might sound the same, but they have different meanings.  Often, they are spelled differently, too.  Can you think of any homophones?  That's right; *some* and *sum* are homophones.  They sound the same, but they are spelled differently, and have different meanings.    'Some' means ['an unspecified number or amount'](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/some).  'Sum' has [different meanings](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sum), depending on how it's used in a sentence.  The verb 'to sum up' means 'to give a brief summary.'  Pop quiz!  Which of these homophones correctly fills in the blank:  >Did you just **___** up the EU?  If you answered *sum*, that's right!  Good for you!  If you answered *some*, you might need a little more practice with homophones. Don't be afraid to ask a teacher for help!

Good thing he didn't ban immigrants right? "Ya roasters"
Except he did.
Well, yeah. She was Scottish.  The Scottish aren't sneaking into countries and committing mass murder.
> ....... and committing mass murder.  That's best left to US nut-cases on their own patch.
Yep, and now we're reducing the deaths. 
By 0?  The amount of Americans who've been killed in America by people from the 7 countries is fuck all.  More Americans get accidentally shot by toddlers.
Toddlers are easier to defend yourself against. Checkmate. I win.   Seriously though, this is about prevention. Past numbers do not matter. 
That is the single stupidest thing I have read in my entire life. That's like stopping eating peanuts in case you have an allergy, despite never having had a bad reaction to peanuts before when eating them.   Yer a fuckin wank.
Hey! How dare you insult the Americans we produce! Yea they're basically rocks but they're OUR rocks! But if you want to throw them into a lake it's ok.
Intae the sea would be better.
Right, because we don't know anything regarding these seven countries on this list. It's not like Obama's administration created this list or anything...   Seriously, think before you comment. These are dangerous areas with weak governments and strong terrorist enclaves. 
>Toddlers are easier to defend yourself against  ...  > think before you comment  Wew lad
I'm stuck in shitposting mode, what do you want? 
[Git tae.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWmH9ylqYYQ)
Did the metaphor confuse you? You've not actually responded to what I've said, just said something different.  To stick with peanuts, what 'we' know is that peanuts have not caused harm in the past, but are now being pushed out with YOUR reason being 'they might in future because of an allergy that might exist'. So to say someone else decided the peanuts were bad is irrelevant because you're supporting it, and I'm talking to you.   'Knowing' about these peanuts would indicate some level of basic human understanding you are deliberately avoiding. How many fine American Walnuts do you know that are part of Westbro Baptist Church? Or the Klan? If the answer is 'none' then grats, you're the same as the millions of peanuts that don't know any bad peanuts. Millions of peanuts who want to provide you with a delicious, nourishing and horizon-expanding barsnack by coming on over to America.  (sidebar: Iran's government is not weak. Some of the other countries I'll fully grant you - assuming you'll concede at least 1 [Iraq] is the West's fault) 
I'm saying we've seen people eat peanuts and die, the peanuts telling us themselves they want to kill us, so we ban peanut imports from peanut producing countries.   What's the benefit of eating a peanut when someone told me a couple of them in the pot are poisonous and will kill.   Don't tell me peanuts aren't poisonous. I saw one behead a person on Liveleak. 
Because in this analogy we've been eating these exact Peanuts for years and fuck all has happened.

Congrats!  You're preventing those next-to-none killings from happening!   Maybe you could prevent the toddler related shootings next?  Or school shootings?
> Maybe you could prevent the toddler related shootings next?  That ones easy, keep your guns safely locked away when your not around them... And teach kids young about gun saftey and to be responsible
If it's so easy to prevent then why does it keep happening?  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/20/toddlers-have-shot-at-least-50-people-this-year/
Because people are stupid and "guns are evil" so no one teaches this age group about them, they are told never to touch etc etc... Well what the hell does a kid do with anything else he's told to not touch with no explanation? Also keeping a gun that's not in use loaded is stupid
Exactly, people are stupid. You can't trust people to be either responsible gun owners or parents. So allowing these idiots access to firearms might not be the best idea eh?
I couldn't with a wave of the wand, like the EO did. 
> Toddlers are easier to defend yourself against  Yes, but a bullet isn't, and if a Toddler accidentally picks up a gun and shoots you (as does happen with alarming regularity in the US), there isn't much defending you can do.  And the entire point of prevention is that you should be able to decide what might need preventing based off of past information.  If past numbers don't matter, then you should logically be banning people from entering the US from any other country on the planet.
Bro, toddler bullets are *slower*. I can dodge them, no problem at all. I trained in Karate when I was younger.

>  Past numbers do not matter.  And this is why everyone calls you people uneducated. Leave politics to the adults.
What does that have to do with education?   It's a preventative measure. Who cares about past numbers?   The countries harbor terrorist enclaves. Fucking ban em.

oh, jesus fucking christ.  are we counting all the white dudes that might have Scottish ancestry that are running around shooting up schools? because that makes about as much sense as claiming that recent events (which were mostly committed home-grown terrorists) have anything to do with innocent people with Iranian visas.
You're angry because you see I have a point. You now realize there's more context and you're unable to blindly hate Trump. You now have to wrestle with logic. 
Yeah, in much the same way a person has to 'wrestle' with cling-film. It's annoying, sure, but not exactly tough to tear to shreds.
I love this.
Well no, because there aren't people from those years countries sneaking into the US to commit mass murder.  Your trolling is lazy.
Man, you Trump supporters should work in movie theatres 'cause you're dead good at projecting.
You call that logic, you trumpet?? What I gather from your pathetic excuse of logic is - something that has caused 0 deaths on American soil should be banned, but stay the fuck away from taking our guns off 15 year old emos and toddlers who seem to have quite the kill streak going on.   You are a complete tool. Now fuck off, you are getting orange handprints all over the place 
[REEEEEEEEEEEEEE HE WULL NUT INSIDE US](https://youtu.be/rPaE8WB-0BU) 
you're right, the only reason I dislike Trump is because I'm too stupid to "wrestle with logic." I can't possibly have already done that bit back in, say, November. Logic won, Trump lost my vote and the votes of the majority of Americans, and unfortunately our antiquated electoral system screwed us over. 
Nor are the Iraqis, Iranians, Libyans, Somalians, Sudanese, Syrians, or Yemenis.
Sure they are
[Per this NY Times article, immigrants are 20% to 50% as likely to be incarcerated as natural-born citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html). Based on your logic we should kick out the natural-born citizens.
I don't care about crime. I care about ISIS, who we are currently fighting.  Eradicate ISIS and I'm totally fine with lifting this ban.
But foreign Jihad is a not one of IS's MOs or goals. Their goals are pretty straightforward: 1) Takfirism, which is the act of declaring other Muslims apostates. In practice this means committing genocide against Shia Muslims as well as Sunnis who are radical enough for them. And 2) building a pure Islamist Caliphate in the levant, in preparation for the coming of the Mahdi, the battle at Dabiq, and several other precursors to the Islamic apocalypse.  For these reasons IS and their ideology rely SIGNIFICANTLY more on drawing fighters from across the Muslim world into the al-Sham to fight for them there. Unlike AQ their focus on exporting terrorism is very limited, and when you see IS implicated in attacks in the West, it's most commonly home-grown lone-wolf attackers pledging allegiance at some point in their attack, not operatives sent from the middle east, as with 9/11.  Also if this ban were really about IS, you would certainly not see Iran on the list.
Iran deserves it, who cares. 
Who cares? What about Iranian students who are studying here? People who travel to work in Iran and back? You do realize we have American born people working overseas right? What an incredible thing to say... Stay ignorant 
Fuck em all, they're all white supremacist nazis
??? Fuck who all? The American born citizens, or those legally allowed into the United States for school or work purposes are now white supremacist nazis? Yo you on some weird shit boy. Sober up 
But I though if IS was eradicated you would be ok with lifting the ban. Iran is literally trying to eradicate IS.
I changed my mind. Fuck em all. Fuck Nandos too. Chicken probably sucks. I know the English like that shit. You're pretty much English. Yeah, you're English now. Haha
If you are gonna troll at least do it well, this shit is embarrassing

Blimey.
Aye but how big's yer boaby?
Small hauns small boaby. 
Ya dumb cunts forgot he married an immigrant, eh?
Naw but we focus on one insult at a time when it comes that trumpet. 
Two out of three actually. Just proving that immigrants will continually do the shiteiest jobs no one else would take. 
As  Mrs Merton's  spoof chat- show might have said: -  "Tell me Melania, what first attracted you to multi-billionaire Donald J. Trump?" :D
I'm confused. Based on the protesters reaction to the executive order, its almost seems like Trump banned all immigration to the US indefinately? I haven't actually read the order, same with all of you here. Can someone who is actually informed assure me that he hasnt' banned all immigration?
No you fucking aren't confused you twat, that schoolyard shite may work on the dunderheads who voted for the Big Orange Idiot but it won't work on anyone else.  The fact is that you can't go round blanket banning immigration from entire nations on the basis that less than 1% of the immigrants might end up being violent. The problem the rest of the world has with Trump is that literally everyone outside of the US (aside from all the dumbest cockheads you can find) look at Trump and his followers and actually remember the lessons we learned about WW2 and Hitler's rise to power, and we aren't having it.
Mmmm yeah, gimme that irrational Hitler comparison, baby. Makes me hard. 
As predictable as an episode of Law and Order, you Trumpettes are.  Trump has a platform of strong nationalism, like Hitler.  Trump has blamed our national economic woes on foreign labor and immigrants, like Hitler.  Trump has claimed that any media which is critical of him is "fake news", like Hitler.  Trump has ousted seasoned professionals from high office and replaced them with inexperienced highly partisan individuals who have demonstrated a startling lack of understanding about the limitations of the roles they are in control of, like Hitler.  Trump has targeted immigrants from just several nations without any real logic as to why and banned them from entry to the US, then proceeded to fire the only person who stood up against that, like Hitler.  Tell me again how Trump isn't like Hitler. Or how about you do yourself a favor and read a goddamn history book before you mouth off to people that are leagues above you intellectually.
TL:DR lol  
word count: 109  keeping the stereotype alive
oh man this is fucking fantastic
Scots and Irish are well known for being the supreme leaders of banter and taking the piss out of people, it's unsurprising that Trumptards are having their flabby asses handed to them here.

Or they start crying that they just want to discuss the issues like rational people but dumb liberals are too crazy.  Edit: HA! Two comments down, "I'm open for discussion, an actual discussion." Jackasses one and all.

Its not a Muslim ban. 87% of the worlds Muslim population can still enter the US. It is a temporary 90 travel restriction on 7 countries, which were determined by the Obama Administration to be exporters and harborers of terrorism, until a comprehensive vetting procedure can be created and implemented. You haven't even got your facts right m8 lol. 
[deleted]
But its not a Muslim ban. I just gave you the facts proving it isn't a Muslim ban. If you're so dense that you can't objectively come to that conclusion then I have no further use debating with you. Why don't you stop virtue signaling and do your own research because its obvious you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Bye

Trump hasn't banned all immigration. What he has done however is broken with UN member nations agreement to not discriminate based on country of origin (also a US law passed in 1967), as taking in refuges from countries in conflict is seen as the responsibility of all modern, civil, developed societies. He's also a turdblossom. 
he hasn't banned all immigration. he banned immigration from 7 countries in the middle east, and only for about 120 days. I don't know all the details, but if you're from Scotland i'm certain you're fine.   now if you're living in scotland and were from one of those 7 countries then im not sure what his plan will do. 
People who are nationals of those 7 countries are banned from entering, regardless of the other nationalities they hold. So if you were living in Scotland but had a Sudanese passport you'd be banned.
Fun fact, the Canadian minister of immigration is banned because he's a dual citizen. If that's not irony I don't know what is.
Didn't Boris say you'd be fine if you had a British passport?
Yes, but he was wrong.
It must have been a day ending in the letter y.
It's not exactly that he banned immigration from those countries - he did do that. But he also banned people who had already completed the immigration process from re-entering the country if they had happened to be out of the country when he signed the order with no warning. So if you like live in Detroit and you took a weekend to go to the outlets in Canada you can't come home. His spokesperson is claiming legal permanent residents are not being affected but they're being treated as though they have no green card at the borders. They should be allowed through just like citizens. Instead they're being detained and in some cases being pressured or coerced to give up their green cards.
> and only for about 120 days  Not really true, it comes up for renewal after 90 days.

I don't get it, Trump didn't ban all immigrants. 
I'm sure his Maw came to America looking for free stuff, too. 
No, she came to steal jobs from hard working, American maids.
Protesting another nation's democratically elected leader. \#JustRetardThings
Whose ill-considered and discriminatory actions have already affected Scottish residents and others in the UK and the wider world. 
And how have they affected Scotland? And what exactly does protesting him accomplish, besides making you look like an idiot?

How is that edgy? He said I'm from TD, I told him why I can't be. That sub bans everyone.  I doubt there was actually any thought in your reply though.
There have been Scots residents, for example,  stranded because of the preemptory, ban - and,  of course, there is the very unpopular proposed State Visit  to the UK which Ms May made in haste and may yet soon regret. (the UK petition against it currently stands at 1,600,000 signatures)   You might also be aware of his appalling behaviour towards local residents,  and his legal actions and haranguing of the Scottish Government (who stopped replying to his letters).  The New York Times recently covered some aspects as well as as the delicious microcosm of him attempting to  bully a resident by erecting a fence and expecting him to pay for it. (still unpaid, BTW. :D )  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/donald-trump-scotland-wall.html?_r=0 
The man really likes his walls. That's pretty funny.  Can you explain how Scots are stranded due to the ban?  That petition against a state visit is ridiculous. Of course President Trump, who like it or not is still the leader of the free world (not to mention the most powerful man alive), is going to visit one of America's closest allies.  His letters to the Scottish government were 6 years ago, and have nothing to do with his presidency. And I doubt people are protesting that.
> That petition against a state visit is ridiculous.   You're not protesting at that protest are you? :D
Pretty funny, but no. Just pointing out that it doesn't make much sense to protest that.  I get protesting his stance on climate change, or abortion (if you're American, I don't get Scots protesting it).  I bet if we asked Trump, he'd say we need to build a wall around the protesters.
By already coming over here and trying to force people out of their homes. That's how your massive alien orange leader has affected Scotland. 
How has he done this? I'm genuinely interested.
Google trump golf course Balmedie and you'll get the picture.   There is also the Documentary Tripping Up Trump (which Anthony Baxter started with a no bias on either side, by was that disgusted with the antics of Trumps representatives that he is now in full support of the residents of Balmedie).   He told people to move. He called people trash when they wouldn't. He complained their property was untidy - it's a fucking farm you moron.   And he personally tried to bully a woman in her 80s out of her own 'paradise' 
"Democratically elected" by fuckwits. 
You sir, are a toaster

Needing to comment on every thread that criticizes your glorious Leader #JustVirginThings
I'm not trying to be rude, but I do implore all of you to actually go read the EO for yourself, not just what you've heard. This isn't a Muslim ban, this is a temporary ban on countries of concern (Trump didn't make the list, Obama did. The only country Trump mentioned in the EO was Syria IIRC). I'm open for discussion, an actual discussion.
Obama may have listed those countries as places of concern but he absolutely did not outright ban travel from them. There's a big difference between this ban and just subjecting travelers from those countries to extra vetting and scrutiny. 
> Trump didn't make the list, Obama did.  I don't see why that is relevant. Obama isn't the one who put his name to the EO that enacted it.
legal immigrant* 
If people in foreign countries have time to protest other countries presidents they should turn their attention to Assads genocide in Syria 
"Team Trumpish: World Protest Police".
Yeah, funnily enough, that's why a lot of us have been keen to welcome Syrian refugees.    You know, the ones that Trump has banned, indefinitely, ensuring that they're trapped there amongst Assad's genocide.
Ah yes, those famous Scottish Muslim Terrorist. I remember the time Nana Trump drove her Mack Truck through the Christmas market... real bad hombre 
False memory syndrome?  Seems a trait of  the Trumpishly inclined. :D 
Immigrants aren't banned though. People are coming in from Mexico, Russia, even Afghanistan and other countries where Muslims are a majority, every day.
The squawk of the red-hatted parrot.  
Says the ginger in an echo chamber..
At least I don't take up much room. :D
Trump?
[deleted]
He's just banned LEGAL immigrants because of where they were born.
And indeed, all travelers from those nations, although he just made allowances for those with green cards.
It literally stopped a vet from flying home to Glasgow because she had a connecting flight in the US. But it's totally not a ban and it's only because of ILLEGAL immigrants.
[deleted]
Dude...he **BANNED** them...for 90 days....Seriously man...
right, why don't you go on holiday, don't come back for 90 days, and tell me how easy it is to pay your rent or keep your job. 
[deleted]
Ah this will be some of those alt facts everyone is talking about. The ban was on anyone entering the US from certain countries whether they have the right visas or not. That's a slightly different thing isn't it.
His grudge against ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS is affecting LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. That is the issue.   THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE TOO LARGE YA DIP
I would say it's got a lot. People are stranded because their connecting flights are through the US. They cannot travel home. They will be stranded for 90 days. That is 3 months 
Because this isn't just affecting illegal immigrants from the seven countries in question.  It's also affecting legal migrants.  You know why tech companies like Google are so outspoken against it?  Because people who work there on H1-B visa's, in other words have already been vetted and have been told that can legally work and live in America aren't being allowed to return to work.  You know what a green card actually is?  It is permanent residence in the US.  They aren't giving them away in those prize grab machines down the fun fair, y'know?  There's a lot of work and a lot of vetting that goes into getting one.  And now people who have been through this have been told they cannot return to the country where they legally reside.  That's where your logic = none comes into play
[deleted]

Oh the irony!
"Well, nobody ever accused the scotts of being an intelligent people :)"  This couldn't be anymore ironic if you tried. 'scotts'!! Haha. Get back in your cage wee man.
lol you fucking melt
You mean the people who invented Whiskey, Steam engines, televisions, telephones, macadamised roads, the pedal bicycle, the pneumatic tyre, tubular steel, the Falkirk wheel, the drummond light, fundamental elements of aviation, thermodynamic cycle, coal-gas lighting, the Stirling heat engine, Carbon brushes for dynamos, two types of wave energy devices, the first steam passenger boat, the first iron hulled steamship, the first practical screw propeller and that's like half of our engineering feats,  We also invented logarithms, modern economics, modern sociology, hypnotism, tropical medicine, modern geology, the theory of uniformitarianism, the theory of electromagnetism, discovery of the composition of Saturns rings, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the Higgs-Boson was theorised in Edinburgh University, the Gregorian telescope, we popularised the decimal point, we discovered Proxima centauri, Centaurus A, the horsehead nebula and came up with the first measurements of how far away Alpha Centauri is, we invented and built the first ever oil refinery, laying the ground work for one of the largest industries in the world, we were the first motherfuckers to clone an animal, we discovered the noble gases and invented criminal finger prinitng and the Kelvin scale. We contributed greatly to the invention of radar, we invented light signalling between ships and universal standard time. And that's just half of our scientific discoveries.  We invented the hammer throw, shot put, curling, golf, cycling, ice hockey, the dug out and the worlds first robot olympics.  We pioneered the use of surgical anaesthesia, invented the hyperdermic syringe, the saline drip, we discovered the mosquito as a carrier of disease, the diagnostic applications of ultrasound, a vaccine for typhoid and for HPV, penicillin, insulin, general anaesthetic, standardised opthamology, we pioneered radiotherapy and X-rays, developed beta blockerd and a treatment for TB, the Glasgow coma scale, the ECG and again that's maybe half of our medical discoveries and inventions.  As for household items, we invented the TV, electric toaster, refrigerator, the flushing toilet, the vacuum flask, waterproof macintosh, the kaleidoscope, the modern lawn mower, the electric clock and the telephone.  And just to top it off we are responsible for The Bank of England, the Bank of France, the industrialisation and modernisation of Japan, Colour photographs, Buick car company, The New York Herald, Forbes and the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine.  All of that from a population of 5 million. So next time you think Scots are less intelligent than Americans take a look at your president and remember that the whole world now has you as the standard for fucking retarded.
"An intelligent people"  Cin ye no string wan fuckin sentence thegither ya dense wee shite.  Pure embarrassin.

Trump only opposes illegal immigrants and terrorists
Yes it's been established the protestors have no fucking idea what direction is up
Was she an immigrant from a terrorist ridden country that Obama listed as a danger? Didn't think so

Wow! Almost as big as the Scottish independence protests.  If you guys keep this high energy up you'll make this happen as well.
Hopefully not, independence would be far more reckless than Brexit and the majority of Scots are with me on that.
You're right. Lucky the people got the message from the Brexit protests and it never happened.
There's a difference between immigration and taking in third world trash. 
There's a difference between behaving reasonably and behaving like right-wing shite-houses.
> and taking in third world trash   Now, now. The Leodhasachs are listening. 
what the fuck does that actually say? anyone go a Scottish - American dictionary? Monty Python was right, Scottish do have inadequate brain capacity
It says:  Yer maw was an immigrant you absolute roaster
yeah still not English
Sorry, it essentially means that Trump is a roaster, and his maw was an immigrant. 
Correct. It's Scottish.  Put down the fucking twinky and read it slowly.
Goddamn I wish my own country's subreddit was this good.
R/Sweden had a pretty good bout with the mouth breathers of theD as well. 
Yeah but they never speak English over there and have you ever tried to translate a meme? Shits rough.
Sorry, I interpreted it as Trump being likened to a roaster, since his maw's an immigrant.
> Scottish do have inadequate brain capacity  Haha fuckin peach! And they say you lot don't get irony.
Mate we invented the modern world with our "inadequate" brains 
American here. I can translate to the auts-righters.  >Well feller, uhuck. I reckon it done did words his mother was a foreigner. Eryup.  Is that better?
"anyone go a Scottish - American dictionary?" "anyone go a" "go" whats that about brain capacity mate?
This is absolute roastin on Scotlands part man, thought we fell intae the 'fuck it, it will be a laugh category' but nah on a serious note he's temporarily banned immigrants from 7 potential high risk countries set by the Obama administration untill they can sort out a more extreme vetting plan to make sure no terrorists slip through the cracks? Honestly not sure what's wrong with that? 
Read how you qualify for refugee status in the US. Work out how to get a green card. Then come back and tell me what this is other than pandering to Islamophobia. 
He's not gonna come back because it obviously panders to islamophobia
If it had to do with islamophobia wouldn't he ban the countries with a larger Muslim population such as Indonesia, India, Bangladesh?
Hmmm, I'll go with [no](https://www.trumphotels.com/bali). 
Because terrorists haven't been slipping through the cracks, and they're banning legal immigrants aswell.
They can have our share of cultural enrichment in Scotland 
You mean we should accept your poor huddled masses who are yearning to be free? Sounds like a plan, after all they're who turned the US into the biggest economy in the world. Well that and slavery. And slaughtering those who already lived there in a genocide.
My great grandparents were immigrants on my father's side. They followed the laws, were sequestered at the dock to be tested for diseases. Half of their family were sent back because they caught something on the boat ride over (so the story goes).  Because that's what people do... Obey the laws of the nations they're entering.  Not a Trump guy here, just sad to see the media able to manipulate Reddit into one big circle jerk.
That ban included LEGAL VISA holders(H1B, student), and LEGAL Permanent Residents before the courts allowed green cards in.  So the LEGAL VISA holders are still banned.
The courts didn't, the TSA and ICE did after they received clarification. You know that the EO is actually online to read.  ETA: Here's a link to it http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-presidential-executive-order-on-refugees-20170127-story.html

I feel like these people don't even know what the ban is. Reading is a good skill FYI.
Literacy rate in Scotland - 99% Literacy rate in US - 86%
Literacy in certain Southern states is a lot lower than that...
>I feel like these people don't even know what the ban is  You do  know Trump and his idiotic shenanigans get blanket coverage, don't you? Quite a bit of the 'civilised' world watches on with fascinated horror,  not quite believing that the US - a stalwart of freedom and democracy  - seems to be descending into a political omnishambles led by a childish buffoon who happens to be  in control of nuclear launch codes.  
> I feel like these people don't even know what the ban is.  Feels like half his own supporters don't know what the ban is considering it is a blanket ban to all people from those countries, not just a ban on refugees or immigrants. If you leave the US and are originally from one of the 7 listed, you ain't getting back in anytime soon regardless of residency status.

Wait until Donald Trump catches wind of this protest against him from a tiny insignificant country across the Atlantic. I'm sure he will step down immediately.
One can only hope.
Significant enough for him to build a golf course here, then get his thong in a twist when we wouldn't stop building windfarms off the coast,  You absolute fucking mongo.
Wait until he runs out of countries that will have him.
Well mind how pissed off he got with Tripping Up Trump. He was like fucking Oprah, cept it was law suits he was trying to throw around. 
Here's hoping mate, so insignificant he constantly visits and owns various golf courses here...
do you alcoholic sheep-shaggers honestly don't get the difference between immigrants and ILLEGAL immigrants?  Trump's wives were / are immigrants, why even talk about his mom. He loves immigrants.
That ban included LEGAL VISA holders(H1B, student), and LEGAL Permanent Residents before the courts allowed green cards in.  So the LEGAL VISA holders are still banned.
Mate, the entire population of Scotland could drink 2 bottles of whiskey a day and rape a sheep every 2 hours and we'd still be better people than you, you selfish, narcissitic, xenophobic, homophobic, sexist, racist piece of beetle shit. 
Our national animal is the unicorn and we are still more in touch with reality than these shower of half wit inbreeds whose entire country and way of life was built on fucking off across the other side of the world and stealing a country 
1st, everyone seems to be confusing the Welsh with the Scottish, 2nd the ban affect all immigrants including legal visa owners, so you can get tae fuck with that argument.
Suck a fuck mate. There's no mention of legal and illegal on the picture. 
>sheep-shaggers  When you're so ignorant you can't even get the insults right. SAD!

I feel like you've taken a *lot* of pills.  Crazy's just the start.
###Notice how they always leave out the words "LEGAL IMMIGRANT"..................
You fuckhead, where are all of the illegal Muslim immigrants? They're all legal.   The illegal ones are coming from Mexico and Southern America. 
Yes course and there are absolutely no middle easterners or anyone else crossing the boarder up from mexico. 
Uh, no, and you shouldn't think that either. I have no idea what data or research you get that from, but the odds of that happening is incredibly slim.   The terrorists who have immigrated here to commit terrorist attacks have done so by legal means. Imagining they're training their people to get into Mexico and then get help to get to the US seems incredibly far fetched.

You have got to be fucking kidding me. Those first two sources you have talk about the Minnesota guy. Who isn't an immigrant, and has only talked about how Isis would like to. It is a report of it, but it's word of mouth and all the sources are anonymous.   That third one is right wing garbage.   But the last one, that's the doozy. That's the one that exposes you as a dipshit who doesn't know what they're talking about. IT COMPLETELY SHITS ALL OVER THE ARGUMENTS OF TERRORISTS COMING FROM MEXICO. YOU ABSOLUTE ROASTER.   You are exactly what is wrong with America. Seriously. I'm fucking pissed and angry the situation we are in because of uneducated and ignorant people like you. You sit here and say there's problems when you can't stop and look at facts or even think that maybe you and the way you think is the fucking problem.   If you think what Trump is doing is right you're not a real American. 
You should replace the 'R' with 'D'.
You should get bent. 
Aww Tiny.  Don't expect me to conform to **your** life style choses. 
You mean like educating yourself and not being a total fucking dipshit?   You're right, I can't expect you to do either of those. You clearly haven't taken the steps to do so this far in your life.
Nice dodge there, must be great to never have to back up your opinions, I'm sure its very healthy.

To answer your question, first, immigration is immigration, illegal or not, the only that truly have the right to assert illegal immigration are the natives, and that ship has sailed. Your sole existence stems from immigration, therefore you have absolutely no right to single out immigrants of any kind. Second, Scotland is a mother land of the United States. Their interests, like any other fucking country on the planet, lay upon the stability of the United States. Scottish citizens have all the right in the world to protests the hypocrite dorito turd, and those like you.

Illegal immigration is not a problem in the US. That Oompa Loompa has turned it into a boogieman to assuage the fears of idiotic middle americans and rednecks who believe it is destroying the country. Which it isn't, at worst it is a trivial financial drain at the federal level, but is a financial gain at the state level and only helps to improve the economy over time.  Proof:  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/do-illegal-immigrants-actually-hurt-the-us-economy.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Economic_growth  http://immigration.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000788  Basically, Commander in Cheeto's nonsensical anti-immigration and anti-foreigner stance is counter productive and will just lead to more financial loss to the American people.  Also, Scots care about what happens in other countries, just like you should, like everyone should. They don't want some idiot ruining the world.
> That Oompa Loompa  Aaaaand you lost those you were trying to convince.
I don't care if stupid people choose to ignore facts because I dared to mock a greedy orange con man on a power trip.  Also, nice attempt at concern trolling. I see you're an r/the_dumbass poster going through that Scotland post and trying as hard as you can to defend your precious sexual predator.
That ban included LEGAL VISA holders(H1B, student), and LEGAL Permanent Residents before the courts allowed green cards in.  So the LEGAL VISA holders are still banned.
Cause he just banned legal immigrants
No, but we've got the power to fuck his gold course up and completely humiliate him by a small local council voting to erect wind turbines all along the coast of his course, despite him throwing his tiny hands in the air and having a wee cry about it.  How's that feel? The most powerful man in your country can't even defeat a shire council? 
I'm saddened alot of people are misinformed of what actually happened. This is just the public's knee jerk reaction caused by the media.

You should probably click the link and discover the level of retard you are. I'll give you a hint, it's fucking high. 
Of all the fuckin insults you could throw at us, of which there are many, you go for this? Are you fuckin mental. Try reading a book ya scrotum.
Irn Bru is literally better than anything to come from America. All the best food in America is from Mexico anyway tbf
LOL. I'm not Scottish, but I'm well aware that they've already contrubuted a shitload to the world if nothing more than David Hume and Adam Smith.   
They don't want to talk about the dead.  
why do people in scottland care about the us's immigration policy? 
Because he's being a cunt.
Why do you care about what people talk about in this sub?
Because he saunters over here with his tiny hands and tries to interfere in our government, and fails miserably.
/r/scotlands keyboard warriors against the Donald's, what a bunch a sad acts on both sides lads, 
Fun but.
But fun
Whit? 
Every time I see or hear fun but my brain burps it into but fun.
It's just a bunch of cunts recycling trump jokes for karma and Americans pandering about how much they "totally love Scotland right now". Half these zoomers are more clued in to U.S politics that some shite happening in their own back garden.

Oh so it is about Muslims? 
Lol. I had no idea Trump's mom was a Muslim terrorist.
But it's not a muslim ban, according to your god emperor?  Which is it?
Hey you stupid fucks, we don't give a shit what you people think. You're a bunch of pussies who can't confront muslims in your country. You didn't even what to separate from Great Britain. What a bunch of cowards, your ancestors are rolling over in their graves.   I seen them marching in your steets u/Hyndergogen1 there wasn't a scot in sight. Worry about your own fear
Mongo? Is that you? I thought you were only a character in "Blazing Saddles"?
Mongo is but pawn in game of life.
>we don't give a shit what you people think  Then why are *you* here?
Do you know anything about Scottish history?(That question was rhetorical, I realise you are medically retarded and can only remember two things at once) If you did you would know that we are not pussies and one of the greatest warrior nations in the world, historically. Also, I'd like to point out that you're the coward for being so afraid of the nasty brown people taking your job and taking your house and your wife that you just straight up ban them.
'Don't give a shit what you think' and yet here you are.  Hahahaha the rest of the world hates you.
k
"we don't give a shit what you people think" Then why are you here and why do you sound so upset?
Hey Scotland, nobody cares what you think about us. 
A fair number of you cared enough to post, apparently.
I guess so. The minority is the majority on this website. So that makes sense. 
Okay, but you said "nobody" ya clown.
Nobody meaning the only people that matter. Sorry. Should have clarified that part. 
So /r/the_cunt doesn't matter?
Said whilst emotionally brigading, away and take your face for a shite.
Yer bib needs cleaning from all the shite you got on it.
Was she a refugee from a country that sympathizes with isis and follows a book that tells them to kill all infidels?
Fucking worse than that, she was a wee free. 
hahaha, belter
Pardon ?
The Scottish Taliban.
I thought you guys said this wasn't about Muslims
Brother, at least the Syrians and Iraqis are running AWAY from ISIS. They been bombed by ISIS AND the USA.  Yes, extreme vet them, but blanked shutting the door INCLUDING LEGAL VISA holders and green cards was honestly too much man.  Sorry for coming off as preaching.
>Sorry for coming off as preaching.  Dude, why do you keep apologising for having a shred of decency?  If you know something is wrong, then fucking say it's wrong, and fuck anybody who gets their feelings hurt.  (See, this is how you do preachy.)
Haha thanks. I just try to engage with Trump supporters as gently as I can, or they refuse to respond :(  Being extra nice seems to work :)
As usual Scotland goes on a drunken rant and completely misses the point.  
Is it the point that some overgrown manchild has decided to placate his weird fetish group of followers, by saying all the successful muslims who have made a life somewhere near them cannot re-enter the country? Purely because these people who have lived in America all their lives can now no longer return? I assume it is jealousy that these people have happy lives and the ~~alt right~~ nazis don't really like that?
> by saying all the successful muslims who have made a life somewhere near them cannot re-enter the country?   You are obviously misinformed on the content of his executive order.  It does not affect all muslims.  It does not even affect a majority of them.  It does not even specifically affect muslims but national origin.  [It affects only 7 countries.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/)  It is only an expansion of what Obama already did:  >In December 2015, President Obama signed into law a measure placing limited restrictions on certain travelers who had visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria on or after March 1, 2011. Two months later, the Obama administration added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen to the list, in what it called an effort to address "the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters."  So Obama was already restricting their entry to the US.  >Purely because these people who have lived in America all their lives can now no longer return?   If they lived in America all their lives (I'm assuming born here) they can easily re-enter because they are citizens.  The order only affects people who are from 7 specific nations: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.  No one is angry at successful muslims.  I've never even heard someone complain about that before you brought it up.  
Fuck you Scottish assholes!  Mind your own fucking business!
You ok hun?

You fuckin twat
I was in London a few months back and never had any trouble using scottish money anywhere in the city. Went to Portsmouth the next day and you'd have thought i was trying to pay with the ears i'd cut from my fallen enemies 
That’s Portsmouth. You know there’s only one brain cell down there and it’s passed around daily. 
Really? Last time I was in London I can't remember a time when I didn't have trouble trying to use a Scottish note.
Yeah for real, i was a bit surprised myself, might just have gotten lucky but to be fair i was only using it to buy food, drinks etc nothing major
Yeah, well I was mostly just picking up junk food at small offies. I guess they're probably less likely to understand it than a supermarket chain.  It was interesting though, they all had the exact same reaction. They all took it, stared at it for about 30s, then looked at me quizzically. At that point it was either 50/50 if they accepted it or not.
I went in 2014. I had no trouble using Scottish money from Edinburgh in London and wasn't aware there were problems until reading this thread.
I used to live between Edinburgh & London, occasionally you'd get the blank stare but it was rare, & then only really with foreign staff. Like the guy said get down in the sticks Bristol/Portsmouth etc they don't have a fucking clue.
Because they are all foreigners who know nothing about Britain.
When I was in the Schue shop just off Oxford Street buying shoes, I payed with Scottish notes.  The girl behind the till thought I was paying in dollars. She was amazed when I told her it was Scottish pounds, and she was allowed to accept them. 
You know...I had a similar experience in Portsmouth. They were really weird with me. At the time I thought it was just because it was coming up to the Scottish referendum and they were annoyed that their shipyards were shut in favour of Glasgow...but maybe they are just really weird with Scottish people?
I've used Scottish notes in London, too (I'm from Canada).  I asked before I gave them, and they had no problem.  They were ten-year-old notes, too, from our prior U.K. holiday (we visited London and most of Scotland on that one), so they probably weren't even the current notes.
Scottish money is real?
Im not sure if thats a real question or an attempt to be snarky but im going to restrain my Scots nature and attempt to answer civilly :)   Yes Scottish money is real and it does differ slightly from English money in so much as that Scottish bank notes are not legal tender in themselves but are whats known as a promissory note. Meaning that if i have a scottish £10 bank note from the Royal bank of Scotland then that note is worth £10 sterling or the equivalent worth of gold held by that bank. Effectively im not giving someone money directly but instead giving them a note that can be traded for that amount of money. Whereas a bank of England £10 is just £10 and thats that.  
Cry "it's legal tender" and let slip the dogs of "ok it's not technically legal tender but it is worth just as much as your English pounds"
[TFW](http://www.rampantscotland.com/SCM/brucef.jpg) your money isn't legal tender even in the country you're using it in.  Scottish notes - not legal tender anywhere.  English notes - only legal tender in E&W.
Indeed. The entire "legal tender" dispute is only really relevant as a technicality of money; it's almost entirely irrelevant for everyday consumer usage.
Yup. It's mostly an archaic term without any real basis in modern pecuniary circles.
>modern pecuniary circles.   I'll bet those guys know how to party, ammirite?! 
They never get a round in though. Something to do with their money not being good enough.
Upvote for "pecuniary"
Welcome to like 60% of legal theory. It's ridiculous and students hate it.
Wait - it's not 'legal tender' in England!?
Scottish money isn't even 'legal tender' in Scotland. 
Wow, I’ve seen more ppl in this thread who actually know what “legal tender” means than I think I’ve met in my entire life. Thanks!
Alright, I'll bite. What's the distinction in this case?
Ha! The best explanation I’ve found is here: https://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes/legal-position.html - when ppl in England won’t take Scottish notes and say it’s because they’re “not legal tender”, they almost always don’t know what “legal tender” actually means
Sooo, essentially a Scottish debt is invalid and doesn't have to be repaid?
My layman’s understanding is that the situation is opposite to this: if A owes B £50 and that debt is covered by law that has a concept of legal tender, then if A pays off the debt with whatever that legal tender is then they can be confident that the debt is cleared. If the debt is covered by law (e.g., Scots law) that doesn’t have this concept, the technically A doesn’t have this protection. But it’s only a technicality, as I understand it.
A strange concept that seems simple enough to clear up.
Scotland can't into tender
If you're trying to get into something tender, I don't recommend dating in Scotland.
If you're a fucking wank, aye, totally.
I've gotten away with using an English note in NI a few times.
Nobody will even look twice at you for using either English or Scottish notes, the only potential problem would be if you whipped it out of a Union Jack wallet.
Or an Irish flag one depending on where you are.
[better yet...](http://www.cafepress.com/+commander_catholic_shirt_copy_mens_wallet,1036570693)
I live in NI and I often use English notes and see them all the time in normal circulation. The problem is when you take an ni note over to England, then there's a problem.
It doesn't help that we have about 5 different banks in NI printing their own versions of notes. Then again, it doesn't help that I've talked to many people in England who think we use euro and others who aren't sure whether it's the north or south that is part of the UK, sounds unbelievable but it's true. Lived in York for 8 years.
I know it's true. I'm over and back to London regularly with work. So irritating! 
In the UK, 'legal tender' is a largely irrelevant concept for day-to-day payments - its meaning is confined purely to the settlement of debts. A credit card or debit card or a cheque or Android Pay or whatever isn't 'legal tender', but shops still take them.
Aye but that's because of what they represent is nebulous. But you get my point. I clarify the legal tender term further down.
I reckon you've seen this 100 times, but in case not: https://youtu.be/5Z3OKE_Os1M

I was in a restaurant in London and went to pay with Scottish money, they didn't want it and threatened to call the police, we recorded the video on our phones, left the money on the table and walked out.  A few days later were went to the same restaurant and did exactly the same, except we just asked for the bill and left it on the table, a few days before our holidays ended we went in again and paid for a meal in exactly the same way.   Always making sure the notes were Scottish  /r/pettyrevenge  I would also like to thank my polish friend pszemek who upon getting to a London supermarket till, jokingly questioned me in front of the cashiers about the fake money in my hand asking where I had it printed, leading to a forty minute chat with the manager and some street police  Never had any problem in Liverpool though
Absolute banter from pszemek though
classic pszemek 
The clue was in his name which is Polish for Pish-make.  PS I’m not actually totally fluent in Polish yet.
> Never had any problem in Liverpool though  I used 3 Scottish 20s to buy a gram of gear in Liverpool no problem. They were punting outside McDonald's as well. Different world down there.
£60 for a gram? Fuck sake that's steep.
Would have been less if it was English money.
Steep? Steep for shitty stuff maybe, cheap for half decent stuff.  Rates usually go like £30-40 for council  £80-100 for decent stuff. 
Aye that's what I mean £40 for council and aboot £100 for primo.
Aye fuckin pure primo none of that over shite. PRRRIIIIIMOOO
Council? Help a Canadian out here. 
Cheap coke basically. Like run of the mill stuff
pronounced, Coon-sil 
Correct!
50/50 is obviously the value bet but usually its just council with a £10 charge for you being an idiot.
Might have been 40, can't remember I was fucked. Thought I was buying coke but unbeknownst to me 'gear' means a different word down there and is a more general word which we usually associate with just cocaine. Think it was some nasty mcat or mdma mix.
why do you use the term "gear" if you're not specifically talking about heroin? do you just lump all the drugs together and call them all "gear" and expect people to know what you're referencing?
I'll have 4 drugs please.
How many maryganas have you injected
Dunno if it's because of where I'm from, but I'm sure gear 100% means coke in Glasgow.
Yup, sometimes hear heroin and other things referred to as gear in Glasgow, but it usually means coke. 
Yeah same in London. Gear is coke.
Gear is steroids in Canada.
Gear is steroids in the US.
Kit = heroin. Gear = coke. 
Depends where you are from. 
Why type this shite like you are the ultimate authority?  Different places have different names for stuff.  Get to your bed.
Fuck off ya middle classed bendy spoon, yer naw even allowed a can a fuckin coke till you move oot. 
Well Liverpudlian gangs used to be the main drug suppliers for various Scottish islands so it doesn't surprise me that they take funny Scottish money.
Well actually Liverpool still has that good Irish blood unlike the Saxon bastards farther south. 
home from home
I used 1000 pesos in biggleswade for a lift to the next town over. Told the driver I gave em extra for doing exchanging the currency on his own after the ride. People don't question shit.
Mexican pesos? Colombian? Argentinian?
Goes on holiday to one of the most bustling metropolises in the world.  Eats in the same restaurant 3 times.  Come on man.
The police in London know what a Scottish note is, and even if they didn't they could radio and find out in two seconds.  And even then why would you wait around so long for them to come?  You've done nothing wrong, just leave.  Not like they can force the shop to take it.
"It's a promissory note, accepted by the banks, so GET IT RIGHT UP YE! FREEEEEEDOOOOM"
Scottish banks... <<< good joke that :D 
What a relevant username. Exactly my thoughts, except less grammatically correct.
I know he's a right knob.
Do you normally refer to yourself in the third person?
No not at all. I thought you understood sorry, my bad sometimes I forget I have to be very very explicit when talking to the scottish. 
You are a cunt.  That explicit enough?
Yea sure. I may be a cunt but I'm still English so I'll always be better than you :>. 
Brave man, g'luck youraknob.
It takes bravery to always tell the truth. 
We've got a classic case of *the Dunning-Kruger effect* here lads.
The truth hurts
Dae ye aye?
I do.
Best done when you have 3 Scottish fivers on the go, just to really confuse them
Scottish plastic Clydesdale bank fivers.
3 fivers from different banks. If you're really lucky, a pound note (RBS pound notes still exist I believe, haven't seen on in many years). 
The way things are going it may be worth more soon
Easier to just not go down south. No worth the hassle. 
What happens when your legal loses its tender?
They shouldn't accept English notes in Scotland give them a taste of their own medicine 
I hate the it's legal tender...you have every right not to accept legal tender.  If I turn up to buy a car with pennies they have every right to tell me to fuck off, just the same as with Scottish money. 
Those aren't really the same though. If I am in England buying something for a tenner and I only have a Scottish notes what's the issue? It's not massively inconvenient like paying that tenner with pennies would be, and the money despite not technically being legal tender is still part of the economy. This means that it has the same value as their respective English notes. There's no reason why the note being from England, Scotland or Northern Ireland should at all matter it's just cunts being cunts.
I understand your point about people being arseholes for the sake of it, I was more pointing out sematics that if people want to refuse tender they can, wether it's legal or not. For instance there's a kfc near me that doesn't accept £50 quid notes because they've had so many fraudulent ones. One reason for not accepting the Scottish notes could be the infrequency of there use and therefore making the staff more susceptible to accepting fakes. When I worked in a shop we had extensive training on spotting fake English notes and coins - but nothing on Scottish stuff.
You misunderstand the meaning of the term.  Legal tender means they cannot refuse payment of a debt if you use it. That's why it's called "legal"
Pennies are only legal tender up to 20p. Pound coins, though, they're legal tender up to any value, so whoever you bought the car from wouldn't be able to sue you for non-payment.
I handed over a Scottish 20 to pay for my lunch in Newcastle during the weekend, they told me "we don't accept Euros"  That's nice Linda, but if you could just get that till opened and get my change pal.
Aye, but it's the weekend and yer oan yir shift in Wetherspoons so gaun ahead an break is so ye's can saunter back tae the yer main shift as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Ta Linda.
Heard stories of my father choreograph a complete exhibition in a pub in Burnley with old Scottish £1 notes with 10 work friends.   *pint arrives, all takes immediate swig* "That's £3.50 each please" *All hand over 4 £1 notes whilst taking another swig* "Can't pay with this, the fack is this mate?" *Hands half empty pint back* "You can't 'and that back, you've drank out it" "Ok" *Hands over 4 £1 notes whilst having another swig* (repeat until pint finished and bar tender no choice but to accept, then carry on to the 8 other pubs they flooded with Scottish £1 notes that night)  
> pub in Burnley  .  > the fack is this mate?  bit far from home that barman eh

Top tip - self service check-outs always accept these no problem (in my experience), so if you're having trouble shifting them, that's how.
That's how I used to use up any Northern Irish banknotes I had lying about.
I use my righteous indignation and scary accent to make people accept my Northern Irish notes(politely).  It's served me pretty well   If I wasn't so physically unintimidating it'd probably even more successful!
'It's legal tender so it is'  'Right you are sir'
Norn Irish notes are semi-common in Glasgow, I seem to get one every few months. 
Aye, self service doesn't suffer from the English peoples apparent poor recognition of British currency.  That said I've only had issue down south a few times, far more often people just take a quick look at it and possibly make a wee monopoly money joke and stick it in the till.    All that said I barely use cash anymore, it's not very often I find myself in England with Scottish notes these days.
you have to admit its kind  of mad that scotland has not one but three seperate ranges  of bank notes issued by different banks in circulation at any time though  msot of  which look like proper currency but one in particular looks like you can ran it off on your canon inkjet lol
It's not just mad, it's mental.    It's just nobody really thinks about it much since we're all so used to it, in Scotland at least. 
yeah that's true.  when i'm up seeing my scottish family this topic always comes up with an englishman in the room and it's always baffling to me how this is genuinely taken by intelligent people, as a premeditated insult to the honor of the people of scotland.   like do you know  how often counterfeit english money goes around which looks like the real thing, of course people are going to double take at being handed a note they've  never seen before... 
The reason its so Insulting is the attitude you get when your money is refused. Its embarrassing. The fake notes line is bullshit as well because all Scottish notes can be checked for legitimacy just as easily and in exactly the same way as English notes can be so to refuse on those grounds just proves that its just English people being cunts as usual.
>English people being cunts as usual  >29 upvotes   And I'd been told this sub wasn't r/anglophobia 
Theres aye wan.
The reason most English businesses don't like Scottish notes is because they have to banked separately and can't be read by the cash-processing autotills along with other takings.   Its extra time and effort and people are lazy. 
As the other posted said, Scottish money is just as easy to check as English money via comparing serial codes, holograms under UV light and via texture.  The only notes which were ever a bitch to check were the old Isle of Man ones.
It's not as mental as it used to be. In the early 18th century, just as these banknotes were introduced, the Royal Bank swapped a huge pile of Royal Bank of Scotland notes for Bank of Scotland ones, then out of the blue, went to the Bank of Scotland one day and demanded the BoS notes be swapped for real money. It nearly bankrupted the Bank of Scotland, and they had to more or less cut down all their operations for six months to get themselves sorted out.  After about 20 years, they decided that this hostility was too mad to continue and started accepting each others notes...
Not trying to call you out but do you have a source for this? Sounds like a great pub story.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland) has a quick paragraph on it, as does [this](http://www.rampantscotland.com/SCM/story.htm) page. Not sure of anything that would past r/askhistorians rigor though...
Thanks
The government should just print one Scottish note.  Or even one UK note.  What's the point of having different notes when it's the same currency anyway?    We could have one UK note with varying stuff on the back per country.  Like we do with coins.  Hong Kong does the same thing where multiple banks print the notes and I find it annoying.  The only reason I don't back home is because I'm used to it.
one UK note with different images on like the coins seems like an obvious solution but which politician in their right mind would suggest that at this particular point in time haha 
>  What's the point of having different notes when it's the same currency anyway?   It was a part of a bribe called "The Equivalent" several hundred years ago.  When England and Scotland "united" what actually happened was that the English sent their army to the border and said "surrender or we invade". In order to secure a peaceful surrender they had to bribe all of those in power at the time. There were widespread riots as a result of this but if they could win over the power brokers then such things could be quelled.   The problem there was that unification threatened all of those in charge of Scotland's state institutions such as law and banking. Uniting with England would make them irrelevant; if Scots Law were superseded by English Law then their life's experiences would be a defunct anarchism. Not so much as "turk ur jab" and more "you are now completely irrelevant". The same applied to various other institutions such as banking, if the Bank of England were the sole central bank for the UK then the Scottish counterpart would be largely pointless.   The solution was to make provisions to allow them to continue to exist. Scottish banks could continue to issue currency while the legal side of things continued largely as before. Then a lot of money changed hands and the deal was struck.   Robert Burn's poem "Such A Parcel Of Rogues In A Nation" [is about this](http://www.robertburns.org/works/344.shtml), the last verse being:  > O would, or I had seen the day  > That Treason thus could sell us,  > My auld grey head had lien in clay,  > Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace!  > But pith and power, till my last hour,  > I'll mak this declaration;  > We're bought and sold for English gold-  > Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! 
Where did you get taught your twisted version of history?
Don't bother providing evidence for your refutation or that you fucking banger.
Aye, cos it's a pretty simple subject, cunt. Needed some spare time to write it all down.
Sooo where is it
History books.   Everything I said is 100% accurate, there widespread riots throughout the country in the aftermath. The bribe was formally known (and officially documented as) "The Equivalent" and was worth £75,000,000 in today's money. It was a personal bribe to individual land owners, *not* an injection of cash into public funds. This isn't some grand conspiracy, anyone can go and look it up, it was all pretty much in the open. Hence the riots.   The history got hugely whitewashed over the centuries to present it as a willing partnership, *that's* the "twisted version". It was anything but. You've probably heard the "Scotland was broke due to Darien" myth, there was no public money involved in that venture, it was a private enterprise in the vein of the British India Company. The country wasn't broke; it's rulers were. This made them more open to bribery than they had been in the past. 
Right, here we go. Your first comment contains truth, mistruth and stinks of oversimplification and ultranationalism. I'm not able to penetrate the real depths but I will try to show you why you are wrong about a fair bit. For someone who claims to read history how do you not know about The Spanish War of Succession or even the fantastic military leader and ancestor to Winston, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.  >what actually happened was that the English sent their army to the border and said "surrender or we invade"  Such utter bollocks, are you reading EDL history books or some shit? They were engaged in the Spanish War of Succession. At that time Marlborough was fighting his way through the Low Countries to France with Scottish support.  Ignoring 100 years of attempts - and even success under a dictatorial Cromwell - to unify the "Kingdom" (I guess we'll call it that).  In 1701 it was apparent Anne was going to die childless. The English parliament without consultation decided on an alternative succession after Anne's death - the Lutheran Electress of Hanover, Sophia. At the time the options were Hanover or the "The Pretender" (Anne's words) James, proclaimed James VIII & III after his fathers death. This was the Act of Succession 1701. Under the terms of an act of 1696, the Scottish parliament should have been called within 20 days of it. They did not, which gave the Scottish privy council enough time to agree with the English parliament to join the aforementioned war in Europe.  A lot of politics later, in 1703 the Scottish parliament attempted to pass the Act of Security 1704, a riposte to the the Act of Succession. It basically said "on the death of Queen Anne without issue, the three Estates of the Parliament were to appoint a Protestant successor from the descendants of the Scottish kings, but not the English successor unless various economic, political and religious conditions were met." It was not passed. The parliament then refused to raise taxes and threatened to withdraw troops from Marlborough's army unless it was agreed to.  The English parliament responded with The Alien Act 1705. It threatened to treat all Scots not already domiciled in England as illegal aliens and to ban the main sectors of trade with England (cattle, linen and coal). The other possibility being a treaty. I should mention at this point, politicians had been negotiating treaties fairly consistently for the last 10 years, more so than the last 80 years, but consistently they had been breaking down, often due to the topic of compensation.  The leader of the leading party in Scotland - Country - was James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, he is considered the real reason the unification was pushed so hard in the Scottish parliament at the time. A massive majority of the Scottish population was against it. It's thought he and his fellows were bribed a modest amount of £20'000 to push it on. He went on to receive pretty much every accolade possible from the Queen following The Acts of Union 1707. An English Dukedom, the Orders of Thistle and Garter and an appointment as ambassador to Paris.  A little more politicking later and the terms were agreed. Funnily enough, the groups of negotiators never actually met, merely passed pieces of paper between two separate rooms for a few days, 'The Equivalent' was never a bribe, it was an incentive that had been a topic of negotiations for years. There was no army on the border waiting to invade. There was no surrender. Not sure who is showing more stupidity, you, or me writing all this shit out for some prat to tell me I'm wrong. 
Of course it was an oversimplification, it's a comment on a web board, not a several-hundred page historical book with multiple appendixes. Sorry, but perhaps you should set your expectations a little more realistically.   The "army" in this case were largely English and pro-Scottish militia, including many of the same ones that enforced The Alien Act you reference. IIRC they used the term "fencibles" instead of militia in the official records here for a better public perception due to historical stigma. From what I remember reading they required Royal Accent to exist which of course only came from the landowners with pro-union sensibilities. The "invasion" would have been militia from England and the Scottish ones imposing marshal law, as they had done previously.   It's far easier to simply label them "army" than have to explain to everyone what a "fencible" was and what Royal Accent implies in this situation, there's a lot of background that needs stated first e.g. the shared king. For all extents and purposes a bunch of armed trained men under the command of the king is always an "army", whichever which way you pay them and position them in an org chart! Sending armed troops to a foreign land is an "invasion" under pretty much any definition. We seem to think in this country that if you give something a different name then the rules change!  Everything else you say is 100% valid & well written but not exactly counter to my point, you only elaborate on the wider animosity & disputes at the time, in particular to the trade issues I hinted towards via bringing up the Navigation Acts. Would you agree that it's fair to say that such situations when left unresolved generally led directly to outright warfare during that period in the European region?   PS £20,000 in ~1700 is not "modest", it's around £3.7 million in today's money. 
I'm curious if you could sort this out for me. From what I could find on Wikipedia all of the places within the U.K. use the pound sterling. Is the money really different or the notes just have different images on them to commemorate different people/places/etc?
depends what you mean by "is the money really different".  the unit of currency is the british pound sterling, £/gbp.  that is the same across all notes.  the difference is the bank which issues the different notes in question.  the majority of notes in the uk are issued by the Bank of England.    in scotland however as well as obviously using a lot of these notes there are also 3 different styles of notes which look completely different, issued by the bank of scotland, the royal bank of scotland, and the bank of clydesdale respectively.  i believe that northern ireland also has its own bank notes but i don't think i've ever seen one.  in addition to the above all of these notes will have different designs on them from time to time to commemorate people/events as you say, on the "english" notes they all have the queens head on the one side though, not if that's the same in scotland?  anyone correct me if i'm wrong! 
Northern Ireland has 2 bank notes, notes from Ulster Bank and notes from Bank of Ireland.  EDIT: I am completely wrong. There are 4 banks that produce notes here.  In addition to the two above we have Danske Bank and First Trust bank notes too.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danske_Bank_(Northern_Ireland)#Banknotes  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Trust_Bank#Banknotes
Oh shit, it turns out we are worse than Scotland ahahhaaha.  How have I not come across the other two? I definitely thought to myself, Danske bank definitely doesn't make notes but apparently they do... Didn't even think about first trust bank...  Ok I just opened the links, Danske bank definitely seems familiar enough but I think the last time I saw a first trust bank note was quite a while ago.  I'm curious to know what notes you regularly come across, is it all 4 or similar to me?
I would guess that the notes I see are roughly 30% Bank of Scotland, 30% Royal Bank of Scotland, 30% Clydesdale Bank and 10% Bank of England. I don't think I've seen any other Sterling banknotes in person.
Oh wow.  Well there you go.  Now I'm curious about Wales... Apologies for being lazy and not doing the research myself but I'm stuck on slow bus WiFi on my phone, I'm on my way to the airport to fly to Liverpool, ironically enough, with a wallet of Ulster bank notes. I assume I won't have a problem though.
I hope all your cash transactions go smoothly! :)
So all of these notes issued from the different banks are legal tender in any part of the UK right, no matter what bank they come from?
well "legal tender" is its own specific term!  but yes all the notes are legal currency.  at the same time a shopkeeper is not obliged to accept any money from anybody at any point, hence the problems that arise sometimes with people bring some of the more obscure notes into some parts of england.  i don't mean to be offensive with my use of obscure, i'm just saying that i've lived in this country for 4 decades and only learned in this thread that northern ireland has more than one type of notes!  is all a bit odd and archaic isn't it.  
>well "legal tender" is its own specific term!   Currency offered in payment of a debt?  I just ask because on our money it says "the note is legal tender for all debts, public and private".    A lot of things are quite odd from across the pond I suppose. 
Currency offered in payment of debt is correct but they are not legally obligated unless its an English note in England or Wales. All other notes are not legal tender.
It's the "same" currency for almost all purposes, just some of it is issued by different banks.  The Bank of England is the one that "makes" money i.e. decides for new notes to be printed. Some of that allocation goes to other banks. For every Bank of Scotland note printed there is an IOU (seriously) at the Bank of England denoting this. They used to use notes such as the "Titan" worth £100 million to signify this but that's not done any more. 
TIL self-scan machines are less discriminating than English people. 😂
You know I got handed a Northern Irish £5 note last year, and I looked at it like what the fuck is this shit? It said something like bank of ulster, weird picture etc. I am Scottish and this happened in Glasgow and if I am being honest it was in that moment I realised how southern Englanders felt when they get handed Scottish notes.
It's not poor recognition.We know what they look like.  We just don't want them or the hassle they bring. 
Wouldn't want someone getting the wrong impression and thinking we're Scottish now, would we. 
Surely the only hassle is caused by other people wanting to avoid the hassle?
It's hassle, all the way down.  Past time there was one note design for everyone.
Gods forbid everyone took them and there was no hassle at all then eigh?
I had way too many fail in Kent. Won't be doing that again. 
I've had trouble with the machines at London tube stations, and they would need to be specifically tweaked to *not* accept them.  Although they got into bother for this a few years back, so they may have changed this.
I fixed this problem by just not going to England.
I love the signs on the motorway to England:  **Welcome to England.**  followed by  **NO U TURN!**
>NO U TURN!  [Tories....uh...find a way](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/22/theresa-may-u-turn-brexit-european-court-justice)
The easiest solution
Sounds a desirable arrangement to both nations. 
A friend of mine who hails from South of the border sent me £20 for my birthday, but it was an English note, so I just threw it away.
SNP voter
https://i.imgur.com/RfMRqFj.jpg  The funny thing is, the friend in question, who really did send me an English twenty, was previously feeling a bit nervous about the result of the Scottish referendum, (he lives in Scotland), but he recently told me that he voted SNP in the last election!! So I am actually managing to convert Sassenachs to the cause, which is pretty cheeky of me, I'm sure you'll agree.
Purely my own limited anecdotal experience, but quite a few English incomers are pro-indy... up here in the Highlands anyhoo.
Quite a lot of the English in England are supportive too, we're not quite the cartoonishly evil people we're painted as sometimes.   There's a dichotomy of feelings in the North of England where we're torn between "fair play, I'd leave if I could" and "Fuck's sake, don't leave us with London!"
English sentiment seems to mostly be "Go or don't, but stfu about it".
Och, he just said he voted SNP because he liked their environmental policies.  I can see both sides of the independence debate myself, TBQH. I'll freely admit it's a complex question, and I'm probably not the most rabidly pro-independence SNP supporter you'll meet.
I find it's easy to be pro-independence in the highlands, the beauty, the wonderful people, the common sense, it just makes sense to me.   Then I go back to Glasgow, catch a pure jake stealing from a charity shop, get called a mad roaster for stopping him (the ladies there were very grateful, however) and think "Christ, we need all the fucking backup we can get".
Not gonna lie, the only reason I'm unhappy with the SNP is that they want to leave the UK, while I'd much rather they run it. They're saner than a lot of the other runners at least.

You couldn’t have gone to the bank and exchanged it? Edit: Sorry, didn’t know it was a joke.
It’s a joke
Its a joke, most people dont care about english money here and we dont decline it unlike some ungrateful pricks down south
I'd decline it, they're boring - we've got 3 variants already, no need for an ugly fourth.

IT'S LEGAL TINDER!!
best comment ive read all day! haha!
Is that the former MP for Dundee?
It is indeed 
I remember when I was in Switzerland and had a RBS £100 note. I managed to change it to CHF at a local bank.   Was shocked
If they can horde Nazi gold they can accept Scottish money.
Yeah, when I was in Switzerland I noticed that on the exchange boards they had Scottish Pound as a separate currency. Went just after Brexit so it was a little bit more valuable than English Pounds.
I've never noticed that.   I did live there hence why I was going to a bank to exchange my money. He said he had pictures of the notes on his computer so if they picture was there he could exchange it
It was in the main station in Zurich, I’m guessing they must just have it at major international places.
The Swiss know their money....
I have family on the Isle of Man, always come back from a visit with these fuckers in my wallet  http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/isle_of_man_latest_news/p45_20p_shimmin__2008.jpg
I got IoM Coins, never thought to look up Isle of Man notes...   Want to trade?
Have a Gibraltar tenner lying around somewhere. Bank of Scotand charged be 2 quid to use a Gibraltar ATM, painful.
That drove me fucking batty. Went into a tesco and the old bird looked at the note like I'd just handed her a fucking haddock. It's fucking legal tender. I just want to pay for my food and fuck off. 
> It's fucking legal tender  No it isn't...
Scottish notes are the same as any other pound note you loon. 
He didn't say they're not, he said they're not legal tender which is true. They're legal currency but not legal tender. Technically even Bank of England notes don't count as legal tender north of the border.
What's the difference between tender and currency?
One has a legal basis, the other not. Legal tender is a narrow definition that means someone who you owe money to is required to accept it when you attempt to settle the debt. With currency, they're not.  Ergo, in England if you offer to settle a debt with Scottish notes, they are not *obligated* to accept it. If you use English notes, they are. In Scotland, *no* notes are legal tender (though coins are), so nobody is obligated to accept your payment regardless of the currency used.
Very interesting. TIL. Thanks for the response.

I’m not certain. I’m not a barrister in Scotland to be honest and I doubt most of the readers here are either. I’m just saying that’s all the more reason to provide high quality primary sources in the response especially for something you would figure would be pretty readily citable.
So how do you pay a debt in Scotland if someone refuses to take notes?
The debtor wildly swings a haggis around their head while yelling “Awa' n bile your head, ya clipe”. The creditor then says “Awrite ye jakey fuck. Relax eh, gimme the dosh. Yull git a fatty cutty”
Fascinating. I think I saw a National Geographic about this once.
You have to pay it in whatever way they reasonably demand.  If they were refusing notes though, they could only really reasonably be wanting it as a cheque or transfer.  (i.e. they wouldn't normally reasonably refuse notes, but some businesses just refuse to handle cash full stop.) 
We once had a client from abroad pay for a training course in cash, which was a problem because we had no mechanisms in place to handle cash.  In the end, we picked the biggest guy in the office, and had him take the cash to the bank to pay in.
Yeah exactly, cash can be a right pain in the arse if you're not set up to handle it already.
Give them gear/ skag instead.
I think heroin actually is legal tender up there.

If that's all you had, pretty much yep!
Are you talking about the banks who *promise to pay the barer etc*, or the individual shops?
In all cases. Settling a debt.
Ahhh, right, cheers :)
How do you agree on the value of a debt if you don't have a legal tender?
The value of the debt is not in question. It's how you settle it that is.
I once worked for a Scottish insurance company, and in the small print of every policy is the option to be paid in legal tender.  It was in about 1993, and I reckon the chap was in trouble with his bank and he asked to be paid in legal tender when he surrendered his life policy and apparently he was most pissed off when he got about 20,000 pound coins.
That’s just splitting hairs. It’s legally a currency, tender is what is the colloquial term for using money ie: “Is this legal tender?” Most cashiers will say yes. 
It literally gets to the heart of the issue though. Legal tender is something that has to be accepted, by force of law. "Legal Currency", whatever that is, not a term I came across in my law studies, is I assume something that is minted by a bank?   What Scottish Notes (and English notes in Scotland) are is "Legal Paper" in that they oblige the issuing party (Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale etc) to give you the face value of the note when presented to them. For which you could demand payment in legal tender (so pound coins). Legal Paper is used frequently in business settings as any person or institution can issue legal paper under the terms of the "Bills of Exchange Act".   This is why the distinction is important, because Legal Paper can, and often is, traded at less than face value. So a Bill of Exchange between party A in favour of B with face value of 10000 pounds might be sold by B to C for 9000 because he fears that A will be unlikely to meet the debt, but C is willing to take a risk for a small payoff. (The rules for transferring legal paper are also covered in the forementioned act and would apply to Scottish Bank notes). Legal Tender, however, must always be traded at face value, because if you take a Bank of England note to their head office in London and ask for payment of the debt they will just hand the note straight back to you and you would have to accept it, even if there was a massive run on the Bank or the UK economy was collapsing.

TIL, UK paper money is more or less Canadian Tire Money.  
Never heard of Canadian Tire Money, but yes, based on a quick google they are similar. Basically, if everyone in Canada just agreed on a societal level that you could go to McDonald's and pay for your burger in CTM then you would have to position in Scotland. (Minus some added issues about having the notes be backed by fractional reserves and anti-counterfeit regulations etc)  -EDIT to clarify/add complexity. CTM is most likely a contractual situation though, that has strict rules set by Canadian Tire about acceptance of the "notes". This would make it different from a Bill of Exchange, which is regulated by statute and common law.
No, they're not. Coins are the only legal tender in Scotland. In England & Wales Bank of England notes are also legal tender, but **only** BoE notes.
No, they're not.
They *should* be and people are morons for not accepting them, but *technically* Scottish notes are *not* legal tender in the south. It is absurd and made worse because it makes puts morons in the right.
It's not legal tender 
I've never had any issues with spending Scottish notes, Used them in multiple cities south of the border and not a peep about it being acceptable.
London, fine, Newcastle, fine, Manchester, fine, Liverpool, fine. Bristol, not fine, Nottingham, not fine.  My suspicion is that places with direct rail links to Scotland have seen plenty because the notes will circulate there, so they know what they're looking at. Those who don't, it's a complete rarity and they've no idea what they are supposed to look like. 
Yeah, it's really noticable that in London, no-one around King's Cross/Euston blinks, south of the river, it's a different story.  Bunch of mates were in MacDonald's the other week somewhere in Lambeth around 2am and this poor lassie from Glasgow was soaking wet and starving and her money was getting knocked back so the seven of us started barracking the poor manager.  Terrible behaviour but she got her chips.  
See, this is why I think a Bank of Wales would be useful. It would get more non-BoE notes into circulation in england, and reduce that inherent "this doesn't look right!" reaction.
I regularly go to Bristol, have done for years, and am yet to have any sort of problem.
Maybe just unlucky, but 3 times in 2 days when I was there a couple of years ago. 
I think that's fair enough too, tbh.  I run a pub south of the border and get a lot of scottish money, including some fake stuff. No way I'd have spotted the fake ones if I wasn't so familiar with the real deal.
Nottingham was fine by me, funny cause one of the guys was handed a fake note earlier that day claiming to be a Scottish note, but then was affirmed by my legit money. At first I thought he was accusing me of using fake money and was about to lose the head but all was fine.
i may try an experiment 
Go west of Bristol with Scottish notes in a pub, you might get the shite kicked out of you XD
Living west of Bristol... Not once has the shit been kick from my for proffering a Scottish note.
Ever been to a pub in the middle of the forest, people either love outsiders or hate them
Wraggh my locals so tough you have to punch the head off yer pint to drink it!  Stop talking shite mate, no one cares, it isn't the wild west, and your stupid fruity accent would be welcome in any pub in the country as long as you pay for your beer and don't act the cunt. Same for any of us in your damp, piss smelling toilet of a pub.
Get fucked, come round my local and you would get a good couple on you. used to be a pub by me where people from Lydney got their head kicked in
Ooft, Lydney? You mean well know hard man capital of Europe Lydney?  Even as a Glaswegian that's seen some proper shiteholes, I tell you this, even the thought of some of the elite Lydney mad squad getting set about is making me quake in my wee pink ballet pumps.  To be clear though, when you say "get a good couple on you", you're offering a cheeky wee threesome in the gents after your Pimms to show your hospitality, right?  
Thats why they got their heads kicked
Because they turned down your advances of getting frisky in the lavvies?  Or was it the Pimms? Did they prefer flowery cocktails like lager & lime and that was simply a step too far?
I think it becoming a bit of a stand-up observational comedy cliche over the last decade has informed many English people.  I go back and forth a lot and haven't had any issues in a while but I remember it happening quite often 10+ years ago.
The only time I've ever been really pissed off over Scottish notes was when exchanging them for Euros and the conversion rate was less for Scottish than English notes.  I mean, they have to send them somewhere else, I guess it's not crazy, but I was unprepared to be nickeled and dimed on that day.
who did that?????????????? That shouldn't be how it works, at least not yet.
I've moved to Brighton and my dad gave me £200 in £20 notes before I left. Scottish notes.  Of the 3 times I've tried to spend them here the cashier has had to double take. In the student union they used a UV pen to check it was real, in Aldi they said it looks forged, in another shop I was lucky and she said "don't worry my family's from Scotland".
This. I was able to shift my Scottish notes in London no problem, but as soon as I tried in Brighton they wouldn't take them. Being a Canadian, I had no choice but to just say "but, please?" and they did. Couldn't pull that one in Angmering though, they were having none of it!
Only time I ever had a problem was down in Bournemouth. London and the Midlands, no one looked at it twice
Because the Midlanders are missing eyes through inbreeding and London, well... you know, London just takes all and any money.   Regardless of whether it's theirs or they need it. 
living in london: can confirm
Come from the Midlands: can also confirm. 
I don't understand why people have a problem with it. It's not like Scottish notes have magically appeared over the past 10yrs. There are some places in Manchester that have problems with it though.
Northern Ireland has four sets of banknotes. How many times in your life have you had one in your hand? I've not seen one from each bank, let alone seen one of each denomination.  I suspect the issue is similar with all those bits of England that aren't in close proximity to Scotland or a Scottish transport link.
And one of their banks is Danske Bank!  That's a weird one.  
I am Scottish and was staying in Glasgow last year. Hotel handed me a northern Irish £5 note and I looked at it like what the fuck is this shit? Said something about Ulster and had a weird picture on it... It was in that moment that I truly understood our ignorant English fuck wit cousins.
You get them in Glasgow more often than you might think, for obvious reasons. especially in pubs and the area around Central Station. 
I occasionally get issues now I’m travelling to London regularly for work.   It’s always down to the person, not a business. A cashier at the Emirates Stadium had to check with her manager before accepting money I gave her. It’s annoying but understandable. If they’ve never come across it before they might think it’s fake.   A cashier at Boots downright refused a £5 note so I just used their self service machine in front of her while she watched. That was petty as I should’ve just used my card.   A cabbie went ballistic when I gave him one as he knew he’d have problems with it later.  
I went back to Canada for a bit last year and had to exchange some Pounds for Canadian dollars. Went to the Royal Bank. Exchanged no problem. Got a call from the bank a few days later and was told they owed me a bit more money.  Not a word of a lie...was told that there were Scottish pounds in with the lot and that they were worth more.  Saor Alba Gu Brath!! Happily accepted the extra money. 
I didnt know ethan klein from h3h3 was on scottish money
I worked in a rural convenience store in the north of England. We'd accept Scottish notes, and Ulster bank ones, for a while. Then as they're not seen too regularly there'd be a spate of forgeries flood into the area, we were told by the bank so we'd stop accepting them. After a bit of time we'd accept them and the cycle would start again. We'd have forged English notes fairly often obviously, but because we handle them all day every day you get a feel for them and point customers with dodgy ones towards the bank. It's not ignorance, it's just caution, you see a 100% rise in the number of Scottish notes you're seeing over a couple of weeks you obviously have to be careful. And then yes, get a ear full from a tourist who thinks you're being an arsehole. 
It didn't help that the textures are different now - the BoE polymer notes feel way more plasticky than the Scottish ones
I work in a cash office for a certain large tourist attraction near London, and holy shit the amount of problems we have. We get notes from 4 N. Irish Banks, 3 Scottish Banks, old and new English notes, and now with the new polymer notes, we're also getting euros! Bloody cashiers not bothering to look properly and mixing them up.
ELI5 Scottish money?
The whole UK uses a single currency - the Pound Sterling. Like most countries we have a central bank (the Bank of England) that issues banknotes. Unlike most other countries we also have several retail banks that can issue their own notes. These are all the same currency and are worth the same amount, since each note issued by a retail bank is backed by a note from the central bank.  The issue that many people from Scotland (and Northern Ireland) have is that it can be hard to spend their Scottish-issued (or NI-issued) notes in other parts of the UK because people there can be unfamiliar with those notes and reluctant to take them.
Ignorant American from /r/all here, thank you for explaining that. I had no idea there were different versions of the pound.
But did you know of the $1 coin and the $2 note?
But *why* would these other banks issue their own notes?  Is it just nearly to serve as an advertisement for those banks or something?  I can understand it from a historical perspective when such notes were essentially an 'IOU' from individual banks, but what purpose does it serve today?
All banks used to be able to issue their own notes; it wasn't until 1844 that the Bank of England was granted exclusive note-issuing power in England and Wales. In Scotland, there was concern that stopping banks from issuing notes would result in a shortage of money, so the law here allowed some retail banks to continue issuing notes.  As to why the Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank still issue notes, I think you're right that it's to do with prestige rather than any sort of financial advantage.
I've got a few to add:   Bailiwick of Guernsey and Jersey, both have their own Coin and Note designs.   Bank of Clydesdale and Bank of Ulster as well.  I have even have two different designs of £10 from Clydesdale.  /u/GaryJM, you too.
Sorry to hear that OP. Did you manage to get any Buckfast in the end? 
I had some in my first aid kid. I never travel to England without it. 
An unrelated aside, does anyone else think that Tony Curran could play Robert the Bruce based on this iamge?
I see it.
***ROBERUT THE BROOOOSE? AYE.***
I've not had a problem spending Scottish money in Wales, but I have had very little luck using Manx money. They had the funny texture notes long before we got the weird fivers.
I have used Scottish, Northern Irish, English and Manx notes all over and never had the slightest problem.
Still got any Manx coinage/notes? I'd be interested in some...
No, sorry. I deposited them at a bank a while ago. 
Omfg... I travelled all across the UK this summer on my honeymoon and this was moderately irritating. I brought home a combined sum of £80 across as three ‘different’ legal tenders.   However, as a guy in banking who’s studied economics and finance for the past 8 years it was really interesting to see the concept of fiat currency in practice. 
Why are people so bloody afraid to accept them though? I've had NI notes occasionally and it's never even occurred to me to reject them.
There's absolutely no reason they shouldn't it's pathetic, people used to ask me for English notes in change, to which I would reply, we live in Carlisle, you could walk over the border, you're getting a Scottish note 
I'd give cunts like that those Northern Irish ones, the sideways printed ones.  Awa' and spend that you cunt. 
Anyone tried spending Danske Bank notes in Scotland?  Or any NI notes to be honest.  Always trouble.
Are NI notes legal tender outside of NI? I got a NI fiver in my change and checked online and what I saw said they weren't.
I wouldn’t worry about it. Scottish notes aren’t legal tender anywhere.
Bloody Scots
They ruined Scotland 
Yes in that they are legal currency everywhere but legal tender nowhere (including NI itself). I've always accepted them fine when I've cashiered and never had trouble spending them in Scotland 
Thanks. I guess I should have looked at the precise definition of "legal tender" before posting... What I had read intimated that NI notes aren't accepted as payment in the UK outside of NI, which is what I meant to query rather than the technical status as legal tender.
You're in pedant country now boy. *Spits*.
Yeeehaw!
Legal tender isn't actually a term that means anything in legal terms for any day to day transaction.  Generally, a buyer and seller are free to agree on the form of remuneration, and a seller is perfectly free to refuse any type of remuneration they choose.
Had a few danske bank notes in Scotland, never a problem
I converted some pounds into US dollars a few weeks back, a mix of English and Scottish notes. It was a small town in Virginia, so was maybe expecting some scrutiny on the Scottish ones. No issue, but my receipt had two entries...  https://imgur.com/cf77c1f7-d1e7-4c9d-864f-80e493fefda0
I can't get that imgur link to work

My first thought when seeing this was the [Sontoran from Doctor Who](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Sontaran_Stratagem.jpg)
Is there an issue with English pounds in Scotland? I’m heading over from the States and I doubt I got Scottish pounds when I exchanged.  
Check what notes they gave you: Bank of England is in the middle of replacing its banknotes, and the old £5 note (featuring Elizabeth Fry) is not valid any more. The new one is plastic, and has a picture of Winston Churchill.  There is a new £10 as well, with a picture of Jane Austen, but the old ones, with Charles Darwin, should still be valid until you get back home.  They created some fancy information web sites:   https://www.thenewfiver.co.uk/   https://www.thenewten.co.uk/
http://imgur.com/7nrD2e0   Looks like the one from the website.    Edit: I guess the ten and twenty are old. They feel like the same cloth like material we use in the States. Can I walk into a bank and change them for the new notes?    Edit 2: glossed over the second bit about the tens being good. Might still get a few of your new space bucks to take home. Thanks for the info. 
Exactly, they're all good. The "new" £20 is due to come out in a few years, so the one you have is the current one.
No problem. There aren't really English pounds, as such. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank (like your Federal Reserve) and BoE notes are familiar to people across the UK. This is different to the notes issued by Scottish retail banks, which tend to only be familiar to people in Scotland.
Great, thanks 
Only with the £50 notes as they are the most likely to be forged, shops will still take them, but expect extensive checking to be done.
Good to know, thanks. 
I saw this on a note yesterday and couldn’t help but laugh at that face. 
I had the same thing happen to me.  A cabby refused to take it.  I basically said, here is legal tender, take it or leave it.   
Personally I would like to see the Bank of England renamed the Bank of the UK and to do away with this stuff and just have one set of notes for the entire country.  Scottish banks printing their own money is more an exercise in marketing now than anything else. 
Of course it's nothing but marketing. Every Scottish bank note printed has to be backed by the equivalent in Pound Sterling at the Bank of England anyway. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21145103
Excuse me, as a pedant I would like to point out that in addition they are also allowed to circulate the amount of currency that they had in issue in 1844.
Great addition. As you were sir.
As soon as England agrees to have a devolved parliament and there is a UK parliament then this could happen but not until then
I think most English voters would like an English parliament tbh.
I think so too but it's Westminster that needs to do it... But.... More power to Westminster means more areas getting fucked over which is good for Westminster and bad for the rest of us
I had to have it explained to me twice when I was in the UK because it made absolutely no sense to me on why you guys would do that. 
Ironically the Bank of England was thought up by a Scot, William Paterson.
It's just one of those quirks, nobody cares enough to change it for the benefit of tourists though.  I have always thought it must be really fucking confusing though, never been to another country that has multiple banks printing their own versions of paper currency.
they do it over in northern ireland as well  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_Northern_Ireland
it's how it used to be everywhere, we've just retained an ancient tradition.
Y'know, I never even thought about it until now, guess it seemed normal having grown up with three different sets of notes. 
Wait, so the UK is not a monetary union? A Spanish person spends their money easier in Finland than a Scottish person in England? 
It's the same money just represented a different way.
It's all pounds, its just that 7 retail banks (4 in Norn Iron, 3 in Scotland) retained the right to print notes in addition to the Bank of England.  So you can get pound notes issued by the [Bank of England](https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/bank-of-england-20-pounds-sterling-banknote-adam-smith-obverse.jpg), [Royal Bank of Scotland](https://www.thebanknotestore.com/british/Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland%20plc%20higher%20values/SC863a.jpg), [Bank of Scotland](http://www.treasures-standrews.co.uk/New%20Folderfor%20gold%20charms/new%20scottish%20twenty%20pound%20note%20A.JPG), [Clydesdale Bank](https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/clydesdale-bank-20-pounds-banknote-obverse.jpg), [Bank of Ireland](https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bank-of-ireland-20-pounds-banknote-queens-university-obverse-1.jpg), [Ulster Bank](https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ulster-bank-limited-20-pounds-banknote-series-1990-2012-obverse-1.jpg), [First Trust Bank](https://www.thebanknotestore.com/british/First%20Trust%20Bank/NI.421b.jpg) & [Danske Bank](http://britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/irishlatest_news/danske_20__2012.jpg).  Some folk in England are a bit funny with Scottish & Irish notes because they are unfamiliar.
I see, thanks. It just sounds weird that some people don't accept all kinds of pounds. Never heard that happen with the euro in euro countries.
Well all euro notes are the same and all euro coins have a fairly standard design. 
But I like the variety.
Only if our Braveheart Bobby B gets to remain on the notes too.
Just spent that note in Manchester a few mins ago lol  Disappointed I don't get to ree and tell "Its LEGAL TENDEEEEER"
But it's not
That's not the point.  It's become a tradition for the Scottish to shout about legal fuckin' tender pal and we're not about to give it up. 
I didn't even know people didn't accept it, it's something I've always done 
It isn't legal?... I always accept them, never been told different. Get quite a few at work
It's legal for people in England to accept Scottish notes as payment because generally you can use whatever both parties agree on as a method of payment. It's also legal for people in England to decline Scottish notes as payment since there's no requirement for them to accept them.
Ignorant American, from the other threads it seems like all notes in the UK are considered equivalent and backed by the central bank. Why would only some of them be legal tender?
There was just never any attempt made to harmonise legal tender laws across the UK, so different jurisdictions ended up with different rules.
In our store we don't technically accept Scottish money but I always take it anyways - money's money and there's no point arguing over how it looks.
The day may not be far away when the English pound is so devalued and the United Kingdom is so disunited that we won't accept them in Scotland.
My work accepts Scottish notes. Maybe it's because we're in Northern England.
Aye, I've had that same scowl on my face a few times http://imgur.com/QLfi0uQ
Same with £50 notes. I thought it would be great to have a £50 for a change and it took me about a month of trying to actually spend it somewhere.

That's a Yorkshire accent you fuckin tube.

Why are all British/Irish reddits full of Americans
As long as it's printed with the words "sterling" the Scottish and NI notes can be accepted in England, but cashiers have the right to refuse to accept your notes as every step of the transaction is the clerk's responsibility.   Some just don't want to deal with them, not knowledgeable or ill-equipped and so stick to notes they are 100% sure they can accept and know what they are checking for in terms of fraud.  I've worked at tills and in cash office, no supervisor has trained me about identifying and accepting Scottish or NI notes, only about checking for fake BoE notes. I only knew about the sterling thing from a colleague and the first time I had even seen one  was finding them in cash office. 
We were told not to accept Scottish notes because they're likely fake the more you know.
Rubbish with no basis in fact. In 2015 only 105,789 of 310,676,600 notes were taken out of circulation as counterfeit.
Yeah my manager was like that. I still did take in a fake Scottish note though while I was working, that came out of my wages.
That's probably very illegal, just FYI. Unless england happens to have backwards labour laws.

Ney bother ye can take a sprinkling of salt with yer bank friend.  Have a good one ya goose lmao. 
There's an obvious solution to this - a standardised set of banknotes for the entire UK. It is the Scottish need for difference that has led to this problem - and if I were a shopkeeper in deepest England, I'd be a little bit suspicious of money I'd never seen before as well.  Let's have standardised UK notes - and maybe stick a portrait of Rabbie Burns on the backside of a fiver to recognise Scotland.
Think how wasteful it is to have 8 different kind of banknotes printed (not counting the dependent territories).
I know alot of places that dont take Scottish notes because they are easy to forge.
The Scottish banks use the same anti-counterfeiting technology as the BoE so that's a specious claim.
Have you tried spending a 20 smackerooni note in England?   No one will take them   Plus with Scottish notes there is a much higher chance that it's been used to purchase heroin 
Ah so you're just a bad Troll. Good to know.

It's all legal tender, anywhere in the UK.

From your post: > It's all legal tender, anywhere in the UK.    From your link (the fact sheet):   > In fact, no banknote (including Bank of England notes) qualifies for the term 'legal tender' in Scotland or Northern Ireland.  Choose one.
It's the latter, there is no legal tender. Interestingly, Scottish coins *are* legal tender in Scotland, just not notes. It becomes complicated when you consider whether numerical intangible representations in the form of data (which most money is at roughly 98%) should be considered as legal tender in that they represent the same thing ultimately. 
What's a Scottish coin? I thought all coins in the UK were issued by the Royal Mint in Wales.
Just means coins in Scotland, not coins minted here.  Funnily enough one of the Articles of the Treaty of Union made it clear that Scotland was to keep its own mint.  Naturally the cunts down south just ignored that.
Interesting subject, but have you got a source which concludes it was some dastardly English plot?  I have only found one source (it doesn't seem like a very easily accessible subject), but it concludes:  > Despite unforeseen problems it was brought to a successful conclusion in just over two years, with no hint of mismanagement or corruption.  [THE SCOTTISH RECOINAGE OF 1707-9 AND ITS AFTERMATH -  ATHOL L. MURRAY](http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/2002_BNJ_72_8.pdf)  I've only skimmed the report, but it appears the mint fell out of operation as an economic side effect of union, rather than southrons maliciously "ignoring" the treaty.
I don't know what you mean by dastardly English plot.  I'm stating facts. The treaty stipulated that we should keep our mint and given that we don't have one they obviously ignored that part of the treaty.
Who is "they"? The English? It sounds like you are trying to put the blame for the failure of the Scottish mint specifially on the English. That sounds a lot more like opinion than fact, so I'd be interested to know how exactly you came to that conclusion.  The operation failed in Edinburgh, not London. For decades the London government tried to ensure the continued existence of the defunct Scottish mint, even retaining it as a nominal office on hiatus (ie not ignoring the treaty). It wasn't until over a century later that the nominal position was finally abolished, long after all attempts to rekindle the mint had failed.  I'm not sure how much of a treaty from 1707 would be relevant to today either way. Laws change due to all sorts of outside pressures, it doesn't mean they are being "ignored".
"They" is Westminster. That's why I said bastards down south  What does age have to do with it? I don't see the states in a rush to ignore their constitution.
Even the Americans, with their ideological obsession with the constitution, have made amendments.
The last one being in the 60s.  And we haven't made any such to our treaty so just settle doon.
I choose the latter, the point from the fact sheet 
Oh man I hate Scottish Monopoly!
Being a black cabbie from London, I accept them, but not without a bit of a wind up to precede it.   “What’s that?”  “What’s what?”  “That Mickey Mouse money you’re trying to fleece me with”  “Mickey mouse?

Thank you very much for purposely using Japanese! I will do my best.
You underestimate the power of weeaboos. 
I'd love to hear Japanese spoken with a heavy Scottish accent.
I'm Scottish and speak Japanese and I'm not even sure I could. I'm literally sitting here trying to say words in a Scottish accent and it's coming out sounding like I can't speak Japanese or English... I need to keep trying, this seems like a great party trick. 
It's probably not something you can judge yourself. I know many Japanese speaking Indians, and they definitely have Indian accents
You just made me very happy just reading about your effort. Thanks for the laugh and a grin! FWIW I live in Japan and have a friend here who's Japanese but raised in Oz. Japanese with an Australian accent is awesome. Keep up the good work!
I'm really bad at accents and I don't know much japanese but I just tried saying "onigiri" with what I believe might be a Scottish accent. It came out sounding like a racist Samurai accent so... Yeah, that's all.
This needs to happen. 
I think something might be lost in translation if you scramble the vowels.
I'd sooner like to hear Afrikaans spoken with a Japanese accent.

One thing I often find with people who apologise for their bad English is that their spelling is usually near perfect. Barring one mistake you did well.
Not at all!   Speaking Honest, 80% of my English was made by Google translate ...
I teach in Japan and use Google translate a lot!   Edit: I teach English. I use Google translate to make the Japanese translations of the class lessons for non English speaking home room teachers. You presumptuous lot (and weirdos).  Tl;Dr it's ok to use Google translate.
I really hope you aren't an English teacher...
[deleted]
they have an app so you can check
What app? 
Actually in Asia they are big fans of immersive learning. Some schools actually ask you to use as little of their native language as you can get away with.  Unless they're not a foreign teacher. Then there might be a problem.
I also teach in Japan. Google translate is probably the worst resource out there. I hope for your students' sake this isn't true. 
Why the hell would i use Google translate for my students? It also works for turning English to Japanese when you don't know how to turn a phrase and need to explain something to Japanese teachers. Jisho and alc are also good. Translate is  awesome if you understand it's faults.
ALC is excellent I agree. Jisho is okay, since it's just WWWJDIC reskinned (the "common" tag for example is totally random and sometimes totally wrong).   I still can honestly say I haven't used Google Translate for anything other than the handwriting input when I need to draw kanji, since that's really accurate.   I don't know what kind of situation you'd use Google Translate for that a dictionary would not suffice. Even the turn of phrase thing you mentioned, I wouldn't use Google translate. 
Cool story. Kid here used Google translate and was pretty successful.  I've used it for years making monthly news letters in Japanese. I never copy it, but I add sentences to see the structure and use the word as suggestions. It's a great resource for some, not for others. 
Okay mate.
Came here to say that I also raised both eyebrows multiple times at this person using Google Translate. Yikes x 50.  I do some news/media translation (from Japanese into English) as part of my work and I usually use weblio if I'm truly at a loss on something.
ALC is legitimately good, so why he'd use that AND Google Translate I have no fucking idea. Leave him to it I guess, the other guys in the staffroom probably like "Ah Bob has made another bizarre incomprehensible newsletter, just smile - Hey Bob! Nihongo, ojouzu desu ne!!"
Your English is better than my Japanese :)
To be fair, 100% of my Japanese would be Google translate. lol Still doing better than me. 
And to be fair to the lad the mistake is also kinda correct depending on dialect.
Depending on your attitude towards the instrument "bugpipe" could be a fitting name too.  I wouldn't agree, but I know my wife would.
ya but then sometimes they invent magically amazing words like BUGPIPES! I don't know what they are but now I'm curious.  googled bugpipes was not disappointing: http://img01.deviantart.net/7fe4/i/2015/246/8/5/bugpipes_by_dashinvaine-d98843k.jpg 
Actually bugpipes sounds like Bagpipes with a Scottish accent, so the kid's spot on. 
It's not the spelling, it's the word choice.
Bugpipe?
Right, but there are many more cases where the wrong word was used but spelled correctly.
Well it's pretty obvious he's not fluent but it's definitely understandable and his grammar and spelling is pretty good. Considering how most Japanese people can't speak a word of English, I think he did pretty great.
Also he's only in junior high. He'll still have 3 more years of English classes in High School. Pretty good so far.
Yep. I teach high school students here and almost none of them could construct that without google translate. It is a technical school though so its not their focus and I wont roast them too hard for that.
I think spelling mistakes are actually a sign of being comfortable with the language, that you've gone from actively thinking 'okay what word goes next' to speaking naturally, if not quite fluently. My Spanish pal has impeccable written English but makes quite a few mistakes in Spanish, and apparently I do the same (and never notice until she points them out, the bitch).

"wholesome" means "good-hearted" or "healthy"... so it's nice jokes that make you feel good.  
False, a meme is an idea or thought or behavior that is used consistently and spreads throughout a culture.   Image macros are just the most frequently recognized on Reddit, but things like the switcheroo or the 100 ducks question are also memes
I agree with Dwight Schrute, the word "meme" has been bastardized by kids to be interchangeable with "image macro" or simply "image with humorous text overlay"  A meme is basically a cultural phenomenon that is passed from person to person similar to a fad, but more broad.  It could be a bit of information, a nickname, or a word / phrase.  "Grab her by the pussy" would be a good example.  It is a bit of information that nearly everyone has heard and has some feeling about...but it's not really anything more than a phrase.  
And then even a lot of things that get called image macros are really just toaps.
That's so not what a meme is.   That's an image macro.   Please educate yourself. 
ミムは文化的身元の一部です。  (I hope my Japanese was good enough to communicate that)

What a twist!
Are people genuinely buying this shit?  His sentence structure varies and where he makes a mistake it shows little correlation to Japanese and Google translate is a joke from Japanese > English. He has replied with zero Japanese besides simple small sentences or single words that you can pick up from anime, even to those offering platitudes in his own language.  Come on guys. When has r/Scotland been this fucking gullible? 
Don't be a dick, just let the post be magical. Why ruin it? 
You'd have to be fluent in Japanese to know that. Japanese varies hugely depending on how you structure the sentence before translation far more so than any european language.   If he's translating from a more casual sentence it will sound differently from the more professional or polite sounding sentence it will probably flummox google translate a bit.   But more over I'm pleased that even if it is a joke that it's made a lot of people a bit cheerier for reading it, it makes a change from the usual political shite throwing that the sub is.

I would recommend looking up three bands:  Dropkick Murphys  Flogging Molly  Real McKenzies  Make a playlist on YouTube or Spotify. I think you will enjoy.
Two American bands pretending to be Irish and a Canadian band pretending to be Scottish?
Well the Canadians are from Nova Scotia, so that's pretty close.
Uhhh, the Real McKenzies are from Vancouver... 
Really? I thought Nova Scotia. My bad lol.
I mean, I'm not intimately familiar with the band members but being a Bluenoser myself, I've never heard of them before and had to look them up, and the Wikipedia page said "Vancouver" lol. Its entirely possible that some of them are from the old lobster though, especially with a name like McKenzie.
That's more formal info than I was going on, I felt like it was in some little video thing the lead singer said something about doing a ton of shitty little nothing shows around Halifax before they got their shit together but that may have been an earlier band or just him or just where they tried getting gigs or whatever.

If by close you mean across a wide ocean and not at all.
Across the smaller part of a medium sized ocean, yes. I've got the whole of the Pacific next to me, so a little bit of North Atlantic is pretty tiny in comparison.
Well, you're not wrong but I was more going for the high-energy bagpipe/celtic punk theme.  That's why I referred to YouTube and Spotify as those will suggest other similar artists.

I hope you make it here :) you'd love the Highland Games season (July-early September) up in the north, where there's a piping and dancing and athletics competition just about every weekend in different villages around the Highlands, and you'd absolutely love the Edinburgh Tattoo, so try to arrange your trip around then, if you can.

Wow!   So many songs...  Thank you !    But they are too many to listen to all.   I just keep a note but I will listen slowly later :) 
My Nanna requested Loch Lomond be played at her funeral. Beautiful song.
Phenomenal song and loch
No AC/DC?  For shame
They are Australian no? 
We're not exclusive - anyone who embraces the pipes and is called Angus gets automatic entry 
I agree with that, I studied in your country for 3 months and it was spectacular. I was just making sure I was remembering correctly where AC/DC is from. 
Fair play.  Aussies but I believe from Scottish immigrants.  Or possibly criminals.  Who knows :D
Yes. But Malcolm and Angus Young were born in Scotland.
That makes sense. Those are incredibly Scottish names. It's crazy how the Scots punch well above their weight with significant persons throughout history. 
Don't forget about Bon Scott. They raised a statue of him in Kerriemuir last year. 
Brian Johnson is from Gateshead.   But that's south of the wall so fuck em. 
Thanks /u/DrumminOmelette :D  Also, have this :D  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgzZLNwqvdQ  
Without a direct translation there is no way any none english speakers would be able to figure out what a stauner is.
>When the Battle Is O'er  Know the tune well, but couldn't have told you that's what it's called.
Welp, now I want to go to Scotland yesterday.  Thanks for sharing!
The school I went to had a pipe band that won all sorts of competitions.  Whenever they arrived home victorious, they'd play it on the main village street...usually late at night.  Since I never paid attention to when they were actually competing it'd always come as surprise when I heard the pipes starting in the distance at 10-11pm at night...  Then you head out to listen to them and half the village has come out.  Gave me the goosebumps every time.
what about [Rose of Kelvingrove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWNiPXvmoE)
This is so nice! I'm an english teacher from Scotland in Japan so this message is really lovely to me. Well done for finding that courage.  お疲れ様でした!!
I am glad that you feel so!   Thank you teacher!!  
I'm also a Scottish English teacher in Japan. I'm glad that our song can help you!   卒業おめでとう！本当にがんばっぺ。ここのみんなは応援しているよ！
本当に本当にありがとう！！   I am fine thanks to everyone here!! 
I'm a Japanese teacher teaching Scottish in England. Am also glad.
I'm an English teacher teaching Japanese in Scotland. Pretty happy myself.
Out of curiosity, whereabouts is Japanese taught in Scotland? I think it was German and French that got taught when I was in school.
Based on the Japanese people I spoke to when I was there (with my very mild Yorkshire accent) how on earth do they understand you?
I don't have a strong Scottish accent at all, so it's not so difficult for most people here
American here from /r/all, this thread is very wholesome and my day is a bit better for discovering it. :)
I will see that thread.    Thank you!
Bless

I don't know Japanese, but I'm fairly confident on what that comment says

Same here, this thread is making me want to move to Scotland.
i know right?? something says scotland is where i need to live my life.
Not in Switzerland? Your username is Piz Gloria, correct? :)  I've been meaning to visit there forever. I ordered a tourist information packet from their website a few years ago and received a huge packet full of ski maps, restaurant menus, etc. It was great! So I made a plan to visit... and changed plans and went to Scotland instead... lol. No regrets.
you are correct. my user name is after piz gloria. it is such a wonderful place. you close your eyes and its breath taking views overwhelm you senses. yes you can see with your eyes closed. its why i take stride to not shed unlight to the shilthorn name. 
I'll get there one day. 
here you go my swiss bound friend : http://schilthorn.ch/en/Angebot/Schilthorn/1_VIEW%3Cbr%3EPiz_Gloria_2970_m_._9744_ft/Bond_World_007 
Switzerland and Scotland both seem very cool. Wish Scotland had a bit more capitalism though :(
A bit more capitalism? What do you mean?
just less government interference in general
give it time. with this bruha over brexit, scotland will find their way again. i see scotland as being its own country, free of the crown. the days of imperialism are waning.  
I would love to live in Scotland so I hope you are right

Scotland the Brave is a great song! 頑張ろう from Hong Kong!

Nice to see this having a happy ending. 
Brilliant.
Lol. I think you mean message. M**a**ssage means something very different than m**e**ssage. They actually come from 2 different languages even though they are only one letter apart. English makes no sense. 
I am forever changing my vocabulary after reading this!   Hark when the night is falling, hear hear the bugpipes calling!! 
I knew the lyrics later, but the they are also beautiful!   I love this passage >Land of my high endeavor   >Land of the shining river   >Land of my heart forever   >Scotland the brave!    Great...
This is my favourite part:  "Wild are the winds that meet you,  Staunch are the friends that greet you,  Kind as the love that shines from fair maidens eyes".   I was midway up Bennachie once and I heard a piper playing this at the mither tap. I don't feel patriotic often, but that gave me a serious case of the feels. 
Hi u/a5agi.  I am an old scottish lady (41, if you can imagine that).  I had a terrible time with school attendance too when I was a teenager. I hated that they called it school refusal as I wasn't refusing to attend, I just couldn't.  I was later (much later, unfortunately) diagnosed with anxiety and depression, which was the source of my not being able to go to school.  There was no internet when I was young but if it helps please look up some sites where you can get free cognitive behavioural therapy and anxiety management.  There is help out there if you are having these types of problems.  I hope your family is supportive and you are doing better now.  If it helps you to know, you seem like an absolutely lovely person and have won over the cold, miserable hearts of r/scotland.  Come and visit us!

Thank you!   I will do my best💪💪  
You're welcome here any time.
I am going to visit Scotland when I become an adult!   I am looking forward that time!
Check out couchsurfing.org and you can sometimes find local people to stay with and learn more about the culture wherever you travel. You can also be a host to show people about your culture even if you don't allow them to stay in your home.
Hey, that's kind of cool. Is it safe? Have you had experiences with it in the past?
Generally pretty safe. Most folk are reviewed and such so for first timers, just see if you can stay with people with good reviews.
We look forward to you coming! Good luck with school mate.
Let's make the bugpipes a thing. 
Hmm...   I can't decide it without I consult with my wallet XD
My wallet always tells me to make bad decisions.
sadly mine never has anything in it to make them with

 In the wise words of Matsuoka Shuzo. [あきらめかけているあなた!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE)   
I'm surprised that Shuzo Matsuoka is known in scotland... SSSSSSHHHHUUUUUZZZZOOOOO!!!!!
Is he the Japanese Shia LaBeouf?
Well, I'd say it's Japanese "JUST DO IT!" but more wholesome.

[The song in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSH0eRKq1lE)
had to scroll way too far to find this, thanks!
TAPS AFF AN' STAUNERS OOT.
Yeah, pretty good tune. Gets stuck in your head easily.   Still prefer Flower of Scotland in Murrayfield in Rugby. God damned chill down my spine.   Takes the edge off of losing against Scotland. 
Japanese are not interested to Rugby compared to other countries but I can know your heart...    I hope that next result make you happy.
No result will make me as happy as this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V37Ko4pvioA  Also the next Rugby World Cup is in Japan. 
>Also the next Rugby World Cup is in Japan.    I didn't know that...   Thank you for telling me good thing   I am interested in a little Rugby!
If you can you should try to go watch Scotland play and here the bagpipes and the crowd singing live! 
Japan actually pulled off one of the greatest rugby union upsets of all time vs South Africa at the rugby World Cup in 2015. You should check it out!
I remembered!   Indeed the Japanese were hot crazy at that time !  
> Japan actually pulled off one of the greatest rugby union upsets of all time vs South Africa at the rugby World Cup in 2015.  ^(Second greatest was Wales effectively knocking England out of their home RWC)
England losing at sports they invented will never not be funny.
That second verse at Murrayfield when the music stops gives me chills every time. 
I love it whenever the music stops and the crowd just keeps singing. Whether it's at a concert or a sporting event it's just so cool. I wish I knew the name for it.
I am visiting Japan in may, I am very excited! 
Oh! that's nice!   Enjoy your trip in Japan!
This dude is awesome! Rock on buddy! 
Really awesome dudes are all here! 
Serious question:  Why does Scotland have such a high volume of really inspiring traditional music?  Scotland seems to have a disproportionately large number of traditional inspirational songs than other cultures. Is this just percent exposure perception?
Well when the English try and invade you a bunch of times, you tend to create a swifty song or two to get by.
We're basically the soundest cunts on the planet but the English can't stand for it so they try to keep us down. So that inspires the creatives and also the weather is always shite so there's a lot of time for music writing, inventions, law making etc. 
Were only sound cos it winds the English up. I think they're jealous every one likes us.  We can even call folk cunts and get away with it.
*Looks at Australia, wipes away tear & whispers "I'm so proud of you son".*
あなたのすきなにほんのおんがくわなにですか？   What is your favourite Japanese music?    Sorry for hiragana, my kanji is bad.
Feeling to write in your Japanese make me smile.   Thank you!  ありがとう！    My favorite Japanese music is "Hana" by Rentaro Taki. "Hana" means flower in Japanese.   It expresses a beautiful landscape of Japan though it is a Western style melody.

This is amazing, you're a beautiful person for doing this mate
not many asian bagpiping redditors I bet, so when this came up..[.MY MOMENT IN THE SUN~~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlMOU3ZRBw)
That's lovely if you to say, congratulations on your graduation.   I'll admit the bagpipes alway make me emotional as well.   In a month I'll be in Japan myself on holiday, it's nice to know my home is known by some people in Japan. 
Thank you for your celebration!   I would like to know more about Scotland culture.   And I hope that more japanese know charm of Scotland.  
Come visit.   Bring whisky.

Is romanji easy to understand for native Japanese speakers? Is it taught in school?
Really glad you like the bagpipes- you'll be glad to know in the nations capital Edinburgh, You'll hear them near every street in the town center so you won't be disappointed when you visit :)
I really love bagpipes so I would love to visit Edinburgh and hear sound of it.   I expect it :)
Japan looks so amazing man. I'm a tattoo artist here in Scotland, so I'm quite knowledgeable about ancient Japanese culture mostly.. like Edo period culture and art.   Stay strong! And hey, I'm sure your English is better than my Japanese! XD 
The fact that abroad people know Japanese culture make me happy!   My English is not very well so do not praise me XD
Japanese culture is very popular among English speaking countries. 
I would say not only English speaking countries.
Oh I'm very familiar with it! Fudo-myö is one of my favourite images!!   
Asagi san, Japanese culture is extremely popular abroad, especially with younger people ages 13-35.  Many of us grew up playing Japanese video games, listening to Japanese music, watching Japanese tv and anime and reading Japanese manga, and playing with Japanese toys.  Dragon Ball, Super Sentai (Power Rangers in English), Pokemon, Final Fantasy...all are extremely important parts of many of our childhoods.  Similarly, for the older generation, there is a deep love of samurai movies and kaiju movies like Gojira.  Many abroad also grew up learning Japanese martial arts like karate and judo and even games like igo have become popular pastimes.  You should see how American teenagers react to popular anime from the 1990's:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U15QEbKFN0  And more recent ones like Shingeki no Kyojin:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn8P4xiedWA  And even some Jpop:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQklZI-tHdM  And a comedy video about the history of japan (the information is not wrong, but there are alot of jokes) has more than 22 million views, most of which are non japanese people  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5LY4Mz15o  https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/01/how-japan-became-a-pop-culture-superpower/  (run the website through google translate)  In particular, Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki san's movies are very popular and were important to many of our childhoods.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiEnjrgn0FY  The video above has no Japanese subtitles and is in English, I'm sorry.  I hope you can get the feeling even if the words aren't clear to you.
As an Englishman I'd like to thank both Scotland and Japan for making the best damn whiskey (or scotch) in the world.  Edit: I'm so sorry everyone, I never meant for this to come between us.
Come on...*whisky
Maybe he meant Irish Whiskey.
>As an Englishman I'd like to thank both Scotland and Japan for making the best damn whiskey (or scotch) in the world.  >Scotland and Japan
He said WhiskEy... if his bottle has whiskey on it .. then its irish
Are you a numpty?
すばらしいだよ。スコットランドはとてもきれいだね。私は行かなかったが、将来スコットランドに行きたいです。  がんばりますよ！  
I am happy to read your Japanese!   I hope meeting you in scotland someday!
Okay this made me so happy. I LOVE YOU ALL!
Should you ever get the chance to visit Scotland, plan a trip to Edinburgh during the Fringe Festival https://www.edfringe.com .  It's an art festival with plenty of music.  Also check out the Edinburgh Military Tatoo https://www.edintattoo.co.uk , which has a lot of bagpipes I'm sure you'll love it.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dlerHdryxzo

I just can't stop smiling after reading this thread!
What is a school refusal student? I'm not familiar with the saying. 
Probably something akin to [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori). Basically, the extreme pressure of having to do well in school causes some students to fall into a sort-of depression and retreat from society.  You remember that one kid you knew when you were younger who had the super strict parents and was a hellion as a teenager? Same  principle.
Thanks!
I know others have answered already but I have a documentary!   copypaste: I'd imagine School Refusal Student would be something like a shut-in/hikikomori. Many Asian countries, Japan and SKorea in particular, have a relatively high percentage of people who just fold under the constant performance-pressure.  Watch [The Mystery of the Missing Million](https://vimeo.com/28627261) if you wanna know more!
[Here is an interesting documentary about Hikikomori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWY5hzcG_FY) :)
I believe OP means that they refused to go to school. It's not uncommon in Japan.
Thanks!
I need more threads like this in my life. 
Am I the only one who is enchanted by the idea of calling them bugpipes? It makes them, like, 400 % more awesome.   "Shane, we got that wee bug problem. You seen the bugs, so, shane, what you got fer us? "  "They are the size of fecking shopping bags!!!"  "I know, they ate all the haggis. Any idea of what to do with them? "  "They make a waily sound if ya squeeze em. "  "... BRILLIANT! Wullie, grab yer lil sisters fecking flutes, I seen that in sum movie, lets test this. "  IF as a result of this someone repaints bagpipes as being made from bugs, or otherwise commercialises on the ingenius idea, my only wish would be to get /u/a5agi to scotland, and show him a good time. After all, this brought a huge smile to my face, i'm good. 
Why am I suddenly thinking about "Starship Troopers"?
Knowing japan, this would probably even sell pretty well, and make bugpipe arrangements a thing. 
Hey, you're a nice person. I love Scottish people as well. We appreciate them together 
This whole thread is a delicious haggis sushi roll.
Now I'm hungry again...
I'm not Scottish (by God I wish I was) and this comment will be buried, but this post is amazing and made my day.   I wish you all the best in life, Japan friend!
Want to be Scottish? Come and make a life here. Hey presto! You're one of us.
Honestly, this is wonderful. Well done on finding the strength to go to your graduation! Glad you enjoy Scottish culture, I one day hope to visit Japan, it seems amazing.
Good luck dude! Have fun at your graduation, there's no need to be shy or afraid of anyone. 
I'm a Scottish person who has visited Japan many many times. It's a wonderful country and the people were always very nice to me. I have not been to Japan since 2011 and I miss it very much. So I want to say, THANK YOU JAPAN. とにかく、あなたの英語は上手ですよ！
What originally drew you to it, that made you want to visit for the first time?
I'd always been interested in the country due to my love for video games and technology, but the first time was a business trip for a week. Actually I had to fight to go on that first trip - I did the prep work but then they wanted to send a more senior person in my place, and I thought that just sucked lol. The second time was where I really fell in love with it. I was sent there for what was supposed to be a few days before heading to china. When in Japan, 9/11 happened and so I got stuck there and the trip to china was delayed. I ended up in Japan for maybe 6 weeks that time and I just fell in love with the country. Over the next 10 years I was back and forth several times a year, sometimes stating there for weeks or even months at a time. Most of my trips were to Tokyo, but I also spent a lot of time in many major cities. Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, Sapporo, Fukuoka and occasionally some smaller places. I made several good friends, learned passable broken Japanese, and spent a TON of money on gadgets and video games lol. My last trip was in 2011, after which I left that job - not by choice. I miss Japan greatly and often. It was a huge part of my life for so long and I'd love the chance to visit or work there again.
Thank you for telling me this, it sounds like you lead an interesting life. Have you travelled to other places besides Japan?
こちらこそありがとうございます! がんばって!!
This is the most Scottish thing I've ever seen, good on ye lad.
This is what the internet was meant for
What a wonderful post! American here- feel free to message me if you want someone to practice your English with! Would love to learn more about Japan!
I'd say that they could message me to do the same, but practicing English with a Scot would probably make their English worse.
がんばってね！ 時々、生活は難しいね、でもあきらめないでください。 Scotland the brave が好きとflower of Scotland を聴いたほがいいです。 まだ、あなたは英語が上手ですから、心配しない。
Your post warmed my heart, Thank you!   My father is a piper and I know he will smile when I tell him about your post.   I took my first trip to Japan last spring and have missed it greatly since I left. If you ever find yourself in Calgary, Alberta Canada I know both myself and my family would be honoured to host you.   Good luck to you at the ceremony!   あなたのポストは私の心を暖めた、ありがとう！  私の父はパイパーであり、あなたのポストについて彼に言うと、彼は笑顔になることを知っています。  私は去年の春、日本への最初の旅行をしました。アルバータ州のカルガリーで自分自身を見つけた場合、私は自分自身を知っており、私の家族はあなたをホストすることを光栄に思っています。  セレモニーであなたに幸運を！

Bugpipe now needs to be a thing.
This is one of the cutest posts ever, and I'm not even from Scotland.
To be fair your English is a lot better than some Scots
Can one of you trustworthy Scots start a crowdfunding campaign to ship OP to Scotland for a holiday so I have something to throw my money at?
Schedule it for the same time as the Edinburgh Tattoo, a lifetime's worth of bugpipes in only 90 minutes.
My junior high life was over yesterday.   One of the reason I could attend a graduation ceremony is you and Scotland!   Thank you!!!!  
Love me some bugpipe.
They're just using a Scottish accent to say it. If anything they deserve bonus points.
Speak any Nihongo, prick?
Et tu, brute? 
Yes, I lived in rural Japan for four years.
Sure thing man. I just thought it was funny how your comment was laid out.
Ah ok fair enough.
Hai.
I'm going to check every single one of your posts from now on and take the piss when you make a spelling mistake in your *native* language.
I want free spellcheck too!
*spell-check  ;)
You should start charging for it 
Even if I was being paid I'd probably give up after about 10 minutes.
I'd get everyone on this sub to speak Doric. You'd nae even make it 5 haha.

It's a great song.  I listen to it every once in a while and I'm barely Scottish (only by descent, I've never been to Scotland).
As a Scot who's been to Japan many times and absolutely loves the place I'm glad we could inspire you.
Hi friend  As a Scot im glad part of our culture could help you out in any way at all.   I think i speak for other countryman that you're welcome to be an honorary Scot at least here.

OP, Scotland has a few links with Japan, including [Thomas Blake Glover](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/12/11/general/the-scot-who-shaped-japan/) from Fraserburgh! 
This is so endearing. Good luck!

As a fellow Canadian, I would request you refrain from identifying your nationality after this kind of pedantic bullshit. Its not as though they are going to save your post, and whip it out like some kinda Rosetta Stone everytime they need to write some English. I understood what they were saying, everybody else here understood. Yours is the only one that takes the teacher approach. As consequence, we have revoked your nationality for one day. Sorry, but you have to learn.
I dunno, when I was trying to learn French I had my french friends point out my errors so that I could learn better. It's obvious that OP was worried about what they wrote (I'm sorry for my bad English) so I thought it would be helpful to offer suggestions. I agree that it's easy to read, but maybe OP is looking to improve. It's not like I was trying to be a jerk about it.  Either way, I deleted my comment. 
Well shit, no one's ever listened to me before...
Wow, that kinda turned on ya there - best intentions eh!

This is my favourite version of Scotland the Brave. No bugpipes, but I like how it sounds.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GowMI4wvmU4
I think bagpipes and singing, although unconventional, would sound great. But apparently such a version doesn't exist online.
Hello asagi   Come visit Scotland when you're older. The highlands of Scotland are like Hokkaido island. Our fish and chip shops sell food that is like Japanese tempura. You'll love it. 
I'm not from Scotland. Still, best of luck to you! Your hard work continue to pay off.  Recovery from failures is the parent of success. Keep at it.  ファイトオ！

Japan is one of my favourite countries culturally.   I love manga and anime and it has produced 5 of my all time favourite films: Akira, Battle Royale, Ghost in the Shell (the original), Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.  You also gave us Akira Kurasawa who's undoubtedly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  Japan has the greatest transport service in the world and traveling on the bullet train is on my bucket list.  It's also the country that gave us Nintendo, so without you guys we wouldn't have Zelda, Donkey Kong or Super Mario. The world would be a lot sadder without them.  You also gave us Pokèmon: nuff said.  You've also produced some of the worlds greatest ever professional wrestlers like Mitsuharu Misawa (RIP), Kenta Kobashi, Antonio Inoki, Jushin Liger and my favourite current wrestler Shinsuke Nakamura.  So on behalf of Scotland, thank you to Japan for all the great things your country has given the world. 🙌🏼

Oh, we could make this a political post 
Well, the stag is on it's own.  You could say that stag is a supporter of independence.
I'll be dead before I see the ~~ring~~ stag in the hands of an ~~elf~~ dutty fenian bastard!
No, no, no, you're interpreting it all wrong.   The stag is on a wild open plane. The concerned look on it's face is because it has considered the possibility of a similar open space, namely the Anglo-Scottish border, becoming a hard border in the event of independence.
*plain  Unless this is a proposed sequel to that one awesome Samuel L Jackson movie: "Snakes on a Plane" Which I think would be just as awesome.  "I've had it with these motherfuckin' stags on this motherfuckin' plane" (said as chaos erupts throughout the imperilled airbus A380, wild stags charging and goring frightened passengers on their horns as they rampage through the aisles, fleeing members of the public trampled underhoof as they ignore the "keep seatbelt fastened" sign and attempt to move to a safer spot...spoiler: *there is no safer spot*)  I think it could be really great, the next summer blockbuster.
Well, I suppose, technically independence would also thwart the Stag's ability to fly between Edinburgh and London on only his driving license, which he does not infrequently to attend casting calls for films such as that.

Best comment in the thread Hahaha. 
Assimilation complete! :D
I mean, it sorta became political when he said "no politics"
So, who owns that land, eh?
A refreshing change.  Try to piss off the wildlife and post a video of them charging after you like the Mongol hordes. For funzies.
Honest question: is /r/Scotland prone to lots of political babble by people who haven't got a clue or any sense of moderation or how to behave?      /r/Sweden had that problem. From the holy books:    "Our mods stopped politics and saw that it was good. Let there be light /u/norci said and there was light."
I'd support that with gusto. I'd love if the mods done that here.  I don't see the point in folk having a /r/scottishpolitics if it all gets posted in here. It's absolutely poisoned the sub for years now and I'm sick of it to the point where I actively avoid this place most of the time. It should be a sub with content that brings people together  with some sort of commonality, not constant bickering.
No appetite for it. I wanted to but been consistently outvoted by the subscribers and other moderators.   I wanted to ban political chat on /r/Scotland and enforce it be posted in /r/ScottishPolitics, but was outvoted.  C'est la vie.
See, I remembered you saying that but I forgot the username and it was in an April Fool's thread last year and I wondered if it was a double bluff.  It would have, admittedly, been a very elaborate joke.
Aye, we could go back to the good old days where the sub was filled to the brim with riveting discussion such as tourists asking the same 10 questions and Americans talking about what clan they are a part of.
I saw a Hispanic guy ask the bloke that ran one of those clan heritage things when I visited Canada about a year back.  Presumably he was descended from Roberto Reyes McGuerrero.
Christopher Columbus wiz frae Greenock.
I always wondered who discovered Arran. ;)
I miss those days. Ach once we're Independent we'll be back to Haggis jokes and Jablonski tartans.
By that logic if I made a /r/Scottishnature or something you'd ban this post from this sub? 
There's a stark difference due to the fact that I haven't seen many flame wars started over a nice picture of a slightly anxious hare in Inverurie. Whereas political pissing matches make up the bulk of the content here. In the nicest way possible, do you honestly not see a distinction?  I can actually remember pre-referendum when this sub used to be fairly light hearted.
Just don't read the comment if people sharing their views and opinions bothers you so much 
Sure, if that's what you think I was saying then I guess I'll just do that bud.
You said you had a problem seeing flame wars how is that not solved by hiding or filtering those threads?
It's the fact that they're the bulk of the content that's the problem. It makes this essentially a political subreddit and the conversation largely adversarial, even bitter.   Political discussion is fine and can be interesting and thought provoking, just not constantly and in that manner.
I already nabbed /r/ScottishTourism just in case we got sick of the tourism posts.
Politics is the most important topic in Scotland today.  And public engagement in politics is very high.
Id say the political discussion is actually pretty good, albeit biased towards independence. Mostly people with a vested interest so have an actual idea or curiosity about what is being discussed.   Non-Scots don't too often come barging in with ignorant opinions... Who were the offenders on r/sweden, I'm guessing people out with the country who had something to say about... Immigration? ;) 
god I wish we did that in /r/argentina 
r/Sweden had to be locked down because they were straying from the narrative.  Thanks to the internet people are finally waking up to the invasion taking place there.
>I've never been to Sweden but I know more about it than people who live there.
Literally.  The Swedish government and media lie to their people.
Last week you knew more about the Canadian healthcare system than the Canadians who use it.  What other insights has your clairvoyance provided you with today?

I was also in Malmo last year.  I survived 2 grenade attacks and a mugging.
Call me crazy, but I don't think you have ever traveled abroad.  In the case that you have, and actually did travel to Malmo, any news articles substantiating the supposed grenade attacks that you survived?  Are you literally just becoming a parody of yourself at this point?

I will cut you.
Nice. Look at that proud animal framed against the misty wilds. There's a sense that nature can overpower the wildest temperaments and instil a calm, \#putindyrefandbrexitinthewild.
Honest question: does wilderness exist in the U.K.? My English friend there isn't any wild in England. The countryside is all heavily cultivated by humans. This picture could just be a field  with a bunch of houses out of frame. 
Yes and no. A lot of the UK has had some kind of treatment, cultivation for agriculture, mining or tourism has made many areas less 'wild' in some aspects but there are still many isolated areas. I guess it depends on your definition of wild. 
Also, you might appreciate this, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27588210
The Scottish countryside looks the way it does because of sheep, really. 
And grouse and deer
Huge parts of the highlands are wilderness.  But not natural.  For example the flow country is basically a massive area of pre-historically deforested swamplands.  Uninhabited and wild but not the natural state of the area before human intervention.
Braw, how far were you from the stag? Poor thing must have been confuddled.
Was actually my pal that took it, he was far enough away to wait for the deer to move in front of the hill. Has a few crackers but never ventures off of FB with them unfortunately, thought this was too good not to share.
Ach well, you're being credited elsewhere... Is he up in Lochinver?
We're both from Caithness. He went out west just for the photos, some brilliant scenery out that way.
post some more. any videos?
Let me know when you're next over. I'm in Lochinver.

I wish drones weren't so loud. If they made about half as much noise as they currently do, I might get one. But right now they're so loud and annoying. They take great photos though. 
If this picture were taken In Canada it would be illegal for that exact reason. Some provincial parks have banned drones for the noise they create citing sources that say it creates anxiety in the animals
The Mavic Pro is pretty quiet. No louder than a modern desiel car engine I think. Still £1100 though...
A mate of mine has that one. It's still very loud. You wouldn't be able to use it in a park without annoying every other person there. 
Beautiful. Although the vignette kinda kills it. Makes me think someone airbrushed the crosshairs out. 
I would like it a lot more if the vignette was corrected, at least a little bit. 
Beautiful country.  Amazing shot.
Not very Scottish. Where's the munchie box?
That is the most Scottish-looking animal I have ever seen, other than a Scottie.
Wonderful.
As nice of a shot as this is people really need to stop getting drones this close to animals. They're loud as fuck and can cause serious damage to an animal that catches them. 
This is such a nice shot.
Depends if the drone's trying to blow us up.

I wonder if animals think drones are aliens in flying saucers. Must really freak them out.

Nah burnt em all. It's cold up here.

Heh, I haven't seen the Scots wiki for a while. Scots is a [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language), but you don't see it written often, most people only use it informally. There are attempts to get it used more widely, or at least preserve it. You'll still hear people speak like that but usually more rural and older people.
No really. Most folk I know still talk quite a lot of Scots. We were raised thinking it was slang though and not proper. So some people still avoid it. 
Interesting... I was thinking it's just a dialect or slang of English, but it looks like it really goes back as a branch off of Middle English which came from Old English. So maybe that's why Scots seems so relatable to Modern English speakers? Linguistics... Interestinggg..

[....](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/353/279/e31.jpg)
Hahaha I posted this after the Brexit came trough. Nobody understood it.
The loo-est of the loo!! 
Scotland wasn't colonised. Indeed it was forced to accept a union with England largely because of its own failed attempts to colonise during the Darien expedition which put Scotland in massive debt.
It's a quote from a film.
Ahem. The Scottish Parliament outraged by the efforts of England working with Spain to undermine the Darien venture passed an Act in 1703 and 1704 (since royal approval had been withheld) to recover full independence for Scotland by choosing a different monarch on the death of Queen Anne.   The English crowns reaction to this was first to threaten invasion and then propose negotiations.   Their draft draft Treaty of Union imposed financial burdens on Scotland of English excise duties and demanded a share in repaying the English National Debt. They also proposed that Scotland repay the losses of the shareholders in the Darien scheme, many of who were Scotland's nobility sitting in the Scottish parliament. The nobility were also were threatened by the English Parliaments Alien Act which threatened to confiscate their holdings and estates in England.  The Act which established the Darien company had reserved 50 per cent of the shares for English investors. They were oversubscribed within a few days, but were withdrawn when King William made his displeasure known. When the company offered those shares to continental investors English diplomatic influence was brought into play and Europe was discouraged from any investment.  You might also want to consider the troops massed on the border in the garrison at Carlisle Castle and the riots throughout Scotland that greeted the news that the Parliament had been coerced into signing what was round about the 11th attempt at 'Union' by England over the previous century, including the 1680's, 1690's 1702, 1705 and finally 1707... 
Got a good source on the background to that? Wanna read up on it.
Have a look at TC Smout and his 'Scottish trade on the eve of union' or Prof Ted Cowan's 'Scotland Since 1688: Struggle for a Nation'.   Both informative, heavily researched factual accounts of the lead up the forced Union and the myth that poor wee Scotland sought out assistance from kind generous England. Something you don't often here is how fucking genius the Darien plan was. A port on the Atlantic at the Isthmus of Panama and the shortest overland route to the Pacific, cutting out the perilous journey around Cape Horn and some 9000 miles of sailing. It took another 300 years before the Panama Canal was built.   
I can't remember where, but I remember reading that while ambitious, it may have actually proved to be a successful scheme if it had been given the support promised to it by the english.  Alluded to here - http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-Darien-Scheme/   
It might well be true that it may have been a success had they received support from the English. I have not, however, seen anything that would suggest that such support was promised. Indeed, England had good reason *not* to encourage the Darien expedition. Spain considered these lands to belong to them. England at the time were warring with France (as per usual) and needed the support of Spain. From what I've read both the King and the government were rather cold towards the idea of Scottish colonies.
Had this debate in another thread. The noble Norman/Scots agreed to the union ergo the simple man was forced to be colonised. It was their only choice but they were colonised none the less.
True. Not like it was put to the common vote.
Who in turn went on to colonize others.
Excuse my dumb question, but why do say Scotland had been colonized by England? I don't know the history of your country very well, but reading Wikipedia it sounds like the Kingdoms of Scotland have been (bilaterally) united in 1706/1707. ELI5?
Explained elsewhere in this comment chain. This is also a quote from the film Trainspotting.

I can listen to you people talk all talk al day.

*reasons. Damn. 
For England, yes. But if Scotland is serious about the referendum in two years most of the businesses that have hard capital in England will live to Scotland so they get the EU market. That is a lot of capital that moves from England to Scotland.
No Chunnel from Scotland to the mainland, alas.  How would that work, Scottish/EU trucks and trains having to drive across England to teach each other?
Scotland isn't landlocked. You can get to Scotland through Ireland. Thats  good for Ireland and Ireland can basically bypass England. 
And a really interesting learning experience for the rest of the world.

I've been watching Long Way Round and Long Way Down recently and he comes across as a very liberal guy.
I'll have to rewatch them, haven't seen in years but remember them being good.
Long way round was much better imo, I just didn't like the fact his wife joined in the other series.
Really good series. He's got a very humanist side from all his experiences. You could describe him as liberal I guess. 
Yeah I would say humanist is a much better description.
When do Jeremy Clarkson and James May intervene? 
[Prior to the vote but it gets their opinion across.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPz179E7rhA)
shit, i can't wait for the grand tour
They've managed to make a political advertisement more entertaining than all of the new Top Gear. 
Interesting. The former Top Gear crew reminded me of geriatric frat boys, and the majority of their fan base seemed to be Leavers from what I've seen.
That's because a lot of their interaction on the show is a bit of an act. They've found caricatures of themselves that work well together and are entertaining.
Makes me wonder what would happen if Jon Stewart or Steven Colbert came out as conservatives.
It would be a shitshow
So Colbert would be a conservative pretending to be a moderate liberal pretending to be an ultra right conservative? 
Well, a conservative pretending to be a far left liberal pretending to be an ultra-conservative, yeah.
Huh, so like the Kardashians?
Bingo.
> That's because ~~a lot~~ *all* of their interaction on the show is...  completely written by Jeremy Clarkson to pander to his halfwitted audience.   
Think about what a hassle some of their roadtrips would have been without free movement. 
True. And I hate to say it, but I kinda think their support for remaining in the EU is petty selfishness; to hell with the good of the country and its citizens, we've got a TV show to make here, and you're making it harder for us. But, you know, if you all get something out of it too, we guess that's alright.
Half the Leave vote was down to pissed off people who wanted to give two fingers to the establishment. That's selfish too and never mind the consequences for young people, students, scientists and a whole bunch of other people. Just like every vote - people vote according to what will make their own lives better. 
Well it's how they make a living. What the fuck do you expect them to say?
> petty selfishness  most people decide how to vote on things for much more petty reasons than in the interest of their careers
My dad tried to sway me by saying "I had Jason Donovan in my car the other night, even he's voting out." Yeah cheers dad, what other 80's pop stars will be providing my political advice?
While watching the Kardashians and reading about Lil Kim's AMAZING new diet on the Mirror... At least Ewan McGregor has an opinion that is not equivalent to brain-diarrhea
Sure about that? The referendum was on leaving the EU, not who sits in the big chair afterward. I know it disappoints some who looked forward to Bojo antics but what Ewan McGregor has missed is that its that Johnson wants to be pm, but he doesn't decide it. The whole Conservative membership that will decide their next leader and Johnson already effectively lost when Gove stepped up to challenge him.Love McGregor but disagree with his interpretation and wondering where is bar set for ignorant brain diarrhea these days tbh.

Oh man, it's hilarious scrolling down through this thread and reading this same joke over and over again. It just never gets old! 
"&" and "$" - disgraceful language. You would never see such filth in "The People's Friend". 
He had to use "$". Not worth using "£" any more.

The same way Trump walks I guess, since he is about to betray hundreds of millions...
Somebody has already tried to kill him and the betrayal hasn't even come yet.
Someone tell Ewan he's allowed to swear on the internet.
Except he's smart enough to know that a huge number of his american fans, especially women,  think the word cunt is as taboo as it gets. To use it without the edit would been horrible PR.  Just because you CAN say anything on the internet doesn't mean you should...

He's a fat guy with a beard who usually wears a hat.  The way I've seen the term neckbeard applied it basically just seems to mean "someone who disagrees with me". I've seen the right leaning and left leaning subreddits use it as an insult. I've seen the pro and anti SJW subreddits use it as an insult.  The term has lost all meaning if it had any to begin with.

well, that explains why Ewan makes millions of dollars and you're stuck on Reddit whining like an e-thug.
[deleted]
That he's an adult and understands what he says publicly will affect his career and you're a hypocritical child who hides behind the anonymity of the internet while making self righteous statements about "self censorship."  He actually makes those statements on his public twitter with his own name while you hide behind anonymity and makes yours.  When you grow up and get a job you'll realize adults self censor all of the time to protect themselves and their careers.
To be honest I'd rather he just say the word or not at all. Never understood this letter censorship but leaving enough to know what the word is thing, as if looking at the whole word turns you to stone.

Sound mate, keep boasting that you've never censored yourself because you don't give a shit that people might take offence to it and that it will never have any repercussions. Keep being mad about stupid shit.   I'm sure the condescending pseudo-intellectual act gets you far.
Neither is being an insufferable cunt.
You're still deciding what you say when you self censor, so it's not violating any kind of free speech like censorship of others does. Also, do you not watch what you say around certain groups of people (kids, in public, etc.)? Twitter's about as public as you can get.
That's what I don't get. I generally don't post shit online that I wouldn't say IRL, to room full of people. I can't imagine doing otherwise... Shit's ridiculous.
Yes it is.
What the fuc& did you just say?
I'm not Scottish, perhaps calling someone a "c-dollar-ampersand-t" is quite an insult.  ...maybe that *was* the swear.
I think you'll find it's pronounced *c'andt-dollars*.
c'ndt-daolaidhrs
Well, great. Now you've summoned Nyarlathotep.
That's the primary use of the internet though, to sit at a screen and swear at people over the internet without worrying about someone getting offended and punching you in the face.... which can happen when swearing at someone face to face.  Sometimes you forget your not on the internet and talk to people as if you were... this doesn't go well trust me. 
"This is how I use the internet, therefore it must be the primary use of it for everyone else"
The primary use for me would be web development actually :P   I should probably of said "main use of twitter" if I wasn't being sarcastic in the first place. 
Ah, sorry mate :P I don't think the sarcasm came across well when I was just arguing with a guy that was saying similar things seriously.
yeah there is a place for the /s tag at times but :P   I thought it was obvious enough.  I do wonder what % of the internet is now dedicated to social media and the mass interaction its resulted in.

It's *shite* being Scottish! We're the lowest of the low. The scum of the fucking Earth! The most wretched, miserable, servile, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the English. I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand, are *colonized* by wankers. Can't even find a decent culture to be colonized *by*. We're ruled by effete arseholes. It's a *shite* state of affairs to be in, Tommy, and all the fresh air in the world won't make any fucking difference!
Failures in a country a failures!
Excuse my dumb question, but why do say Scotland had been colonized by England? I don't know the history of your country very well, but reading Wikipedia it sounds like the Kingdoms of Scotland have been (bilaterally) united in 1706/1707. ELI5?
Braveheart is a great documentary that explains this. 
It's a quote from Trainspotting.
Where does Ewan live?
Not sure where he's living now but he is Scottish. He went to school up in Crieff.
Cheers.
Probably somewhere in America, but will likely have a house or flat somewhere. Maybe Govan
He's from up near Inverness.
Pretty sure he isn't - we'd be all over that in the Highlands if he was. Nope, just Karen Gillan.
Karen Gillan is enough.
More than enough!
Ooft Karen Gillan
Kevin McKidd is Elgin's claim to fame. He did a short TV thing where he went back to his primary school and he mentioned that where he grew up (Bishopmill) was a very rough place, to which everyone just collectively rolled their eyes. It's not a rough place now and it definitely wasn't back then.

ELI5 what's happening?
Boris Johnson led the 'leave'  campaign,  not because he believed in it,  no one with a fucking brain cell does,  but because he wanted to grab focus so that he could run for leader of the tories/prime minister.  He never thought they'd win,  no one really thought they'd win, but they did.  Now the UK is fucked.  So Boris could have basically walked in to being prime minister. But knowing how fucked it is,  because he fucked it, he doesn't want to be the one to sort it out, so he's no longer running to be head of the tories/prime minister.  Now we're going to have an even bigger shower of shit than him running the country.    Tl;Dr he shat the bed and doesn't want to clean it up
What a twat
Well, Boris did vote to Leave, and now he's left.  He's buggered off.

He was pushed out of his position by a conservative who announced his run and stole support from Boris. 
Bullshit, he never expected us to vote leave he did this to improve his media presence know what a leave vote would mean and now he is trying to go for damage limitation to avoid being the man that puts us into recession and destroys the United Kingdom. Spineless cunt.
I mean, he was. I forget who ran him out, but the guy who did announced it about 4 hours before boris, stealing boris baseline support because the guy was from conservatives.  Also, the British economy is doing better than before brexit while eu markets slumped. So.. not really that bad.
No no no! Gove is the villain here...and I quote "...that I should stand and that Boris should stand aside."  Not "I should stand and Boris need to think about it"  Gove orchestrated this. He knew he couldn't win the referendum on his own. He needed a divisive figurehead who would polarise the electorate and 'maybe' get the result over the line. Then he siezes the initiative. The manner in which Boris conducted his press conference on Friday morning leads me to believe that that was the plan all along.
And he's probably going to magic out of thin air the highly detailed plan which has been absent up until now. I think the whole thing has been carefully orchestrated going back months or years, and his missus, her columns and newspaper proprietor friends have been key to a lot of it.  It's all a bit House of Cards, except in real life and yet somehow seeming less plausible. Gove better watch out before his missus does a job on him like Urquhart. Still looking forward to seeing how Claire Underwood dispatches Frank in the new version (assuming they're still following the basic plot).  How are they going to neutralise May I wonder?
They're not, Gove's role was to ruin it for Boris, May's is to actually take the job.
And Giddy Osbourne in the background pulling the strings.  May is a straight fight but it's a bit like choosing to eat your own shite or someone else's...
I'm struggling to understand the rage-boner folk seem to have over Boris quitting the leadership race. It's been made clear to him that he can't win, he can't force the Tory membership to vote for him.   Every cunt raged about having Boris as Prime Minister before the Brexit vote and now folk are raging that he's taken himself out of the race to succeed David Cameron. Make up your mind! 
It's the principle of the matter. He's very possibly fucked the UK over on an interntional scale all in his quest to be Prime Minister and doesn't even have the backbone to to attempt to realise his goal, unlikely or not.  He's lead us into a mess, it didn't turn out how he planned, and he's quitting halfway rather than at least trying to see it through.
Can they call a miss-vote in light of the circumstances? (Sorry, I don't know how the British voting system works.) Seems he mislead the public and blatantly lied.
[deleted]
Him having had a sit down in February and thinking to himself "Is this what I really want? If not then I probably shouldn't do it...". 
I don't understand the question. I've quite clearly said on principle he should've tried to see it through, so surely that's your answer?
[deleted]
I don't particularly care who's in charge of the Tory party. I have not ever and do not presently foresee me being one of their voters.
> he can't force the Tory membership to vote for him  He could always try that crazy democratic idea of persuading them.
Indeed but just read a FT article basically saying he's been fucked over by Gove. If anything people on here should be bragging not lamenting that he won't be prime minister.
I think we're lamenting his further national humiliation more than anything else.   Also as pm there would have been a good chance of him delivering an independence winning quote about the Scots 
That might be part of the reason Gove knifed him.
Boris not going to be PM? Good, let there be dancing in the streets.   Gove might be PM instead? Oh my holy fuck no. Bring back Boris. 
Like that crazy democratic idea of calling another referendum because some parts of the UK didn't agree with us? Or that "the old white people who remembered what it was like before the EU turned into a political facist state, who ultimately decided the vote, they shouldn't matter because they are going to be dead soon"...?
What on earth are you on about?
Excuse me? You haven't been following the news? The swathes of people calling for another referendum because the previous democratic vote didn't go their way. Or the "progressive" voters who say that the older generation that ultimately decided the referendum, their democratic vote should be voided because they will die soon, and it isn't "their future". That last one always gives me a pained smile.  But to point it out, it was a bit of a dig mate. Sorry I wasn't more clear.
> The swathes of people calling for another referendum because the previous democratic vote didn't go their way.  I heard that the main reason people voted to stay in the UK was to remain part of the EU. Considering Scotland as a whole voted overwhelmingly in favor of staying in the EU but the UK is leaving anyways, on top of the fact that Westminster reneged on its promises to Scotland after the referendum, I don't see why they shouldn't get another one. Their main reasons for staying are now moot so they should be able to leave, especially since none of it is their fault.  I'm American so I may not be getting the full story, but this is all going on what I've heard in the media and from people I know who follow European politics more than I do.
[deleted]
Ohhh gotcha. I thought you were talking about the UK referendum, not the EU one. My bad.
Right...and what has that got to with anything here?
Your dig at buffoon Borris. Sarcastic comments were thrown around about democracy so I thought I'd put my two pence worth in mate. 
Oh they weren't sarcastic. I was deadly serious.
As were my two points.
just like the idea that your country is gonna splinter to shards soon and whatever relevance you have had since ww2 will be gone.  londons getting out, scotlands getting out, irelands getting out. falklands are going back to argentina and Gibraltar is going to spain gg.
I'm scottish you silly twat.
even worse because you guys are probably heading right back to the EU. it was clear how scotland voted. it wasnt wishy washy 52-48.
So you're not scottish? You're hanging around on a scottish sub and saw my comment thinking I was english, so decided to give me shit how england and all of the UK's overseas territories are going to dissolve completely because of this vote....   But getting back to the bulk of your reply, why do you say  >even worse because you guys are probably heading back to the EU
you are on /r/all buddy stop being a retard. god the gall of this idiot complaining that his public post on a public fourm is being read no wonder you thought scotland voted leave.
Sorry "buddy". I didn't realise this post took off so much to get anti UK foreign redditers so wet in the knickers.  >buddy stop being a retard. God the gall of this idiot.  Thank you for your input mate x  
London is going nowhere, Scotland might leave, Ireland probably wont, even with a splintered UK Argentina don't have the naval might to go after the Falklands, and Gibraltar wants nothing to do with Spain.
It's the scummiest thing I've seen from a Tory in a while.  You don't go balls out on a campaign like that and then just meekly back down as soon as you win it, even if that wasn't your intention as is becoming abundantly clear.  He should have stood up and taken the flack for it, instead he scurries off like a wee rat.  Gove is a cunt but at least he's going to face election by his party.  We all know what will happen to him if he doesn't keep the brexiteers on side though, he could very well just be in the role temporarily.   
You know precisely why people are pissed off, you're just being Edgy McEdgeface again.
They're probably annoyed because all through the referendum they said 'fuck sakes if we vote Leave Boris Johnson will be the Prime Minister', and are now pissed off they've been proven wrong and their simplistic bollocks has been shown up for what it is.
Oh and I'm sure you knew Boris was going to step down, did you? I'm fairly certain I remember you saying that we were never going to Leave in the first place 
So, I convince you to throw your ice cream on the ground. I tell you, it's going to be great, because when you do I'm going to make ice cream appear for you anytime you want it, for the rest of your life. So you throw your ice cream on the ground and ask to be rewarded with the ice cream for life and I say, "well, I can't do that, that's impossible", and walk away. I could at least try, but I knew from the beginning that it was impossible, and watched you do it anyway. Because I'm an asshole.
If he really cared so passionately like he claimed he did, then he would at least try. There are cunts in the race with something like 7% support.
Why can't he win? I thought he was more liked in the south than Gove (up until he just fucked off) 
Jokes aside, there is a very valid point being made.  It's clear that the Leave campaign pushed to exit the EU simply for political clout and gain.  The fact that the very people who pushed so hard for this also had no plan going forward if they actually won means their intentions weren't to win, but to substantiate their political posture.    Had they actually had a plan, a desire for leadership, a vision for the future of the United Kingdom and how they would pursue it outside of the EU, they would have been prepared.  Normally in any campaign of any type, there is focus early on for what you're standing for, then as you gain momentum, behind the scenes you are planning the next phases.  The fact that this didn't happen, with experienced politicians, suggest they weren't serious.  This was all for personal political gain, not for the good of the UK.  I think that should, rightly, piss people off.
Given the gravity of the situation. I think the only noble thing he could do now is come out and say "this was all a big wheeze, and it's gone very, very wrong. Please don't bugger the country up for the next 40 years because I was a bit of a twat" and then see himself out.
Probably a joke account

What's so great about the EU?
"What have the romans ever done for us?"
Sorry, I don't understand the reference.
The Life of Brian a Monty Python film. It is a scene about the Jews railing against the occupation of the Romans and asking what they have done for them. They then start to figure out that the comfortable lives they live are because of the Romans bringing in technology. They say duck it anyway though and continue hating. 
This would seem to be a case of conflating the EU as a political organization with Europe as a continent which doesn't seem to fit.  What has the EU itself done that's been so great for the UK?
I honestly couldn't say. I was only explaining the movie quote. I'm an American who doesn't understand much of modern European politics. I'm an English and Anthropology student. I can't answer that question in a good way that would come off correctly.

I love Ewan.  Long way around and long way down!
I swear on me mum's grave if that boy Brois comes round, I will knock him in the jabber.
Wow what a comment from such educated, experienced and relevant person 
Oooor, just possibly, he knows full well that him stepping down is the best option for the country. So actually not a dick move, rather selfless in fact. I wish actors/celebrities would shut the fuck up. They live in a fucking bubble. I wonder how much travelling he's done around the UK to some of the more poverty stricken areas - the areas from which most of the "Leave" votes came. This liberal idealism sickens me (the sort you get from celebrities trying to make themselves sound oh so altruistic and wonderful), it's irresponsible for people who are in positions where fucktards look up to them and (worst of all, listen to them) to say this. All it does, in this case, is further stoke the fires of uncertainty. When celebrities start giving up their lavish lifestyles in order to fight poverty around the world, then they can start preaching about socialism. Until then, they should wind their necks in. In fact, everyone just needs to chill the fuck out about the whole Brexit thing. The world has not fallen into an abyss, some of the markets are actually up from before the referendum. Keep Calm and Carry On. 
What the hell is a cdollarsignampersandt and what does fucampersand mean? I'm so confused.

Ewan mcgregor is such a fucking pussy. I bet he couldn't name 10 things that the eu does and how things will be different after the be be brexit.

We could fix the Lib Dems fuck ups after 4 years with another general. No such luck with this one.

Yes I hate Boris Johnson because David Tenant said he has very silly hair.
David Tenant just read out a tweet about that.
I've changed my mind then
Yeah quite a shame tbh. If it wasn't for Cheggers we'd still be in the EU.
When will Sturgeon condemn?
Condemn someone for expressing their opinion on social media? Away and play in the traffic :)  It isn't a crime to call someone a cunt. Sorry, c$&t.
More cybernat abuse. Vile, frankly. Salmond has a lot to answer for.  Death eaters, fascists of the left and right, vitriol e.t.c.
So basically he has no idea what he's talking about. 
Used to have respect for this cunt.

Ok, Scots, you all have a collective responsibility to create a dub for the original trilogy.  Needs to be understandable, so try and lean more towards Trainspotting, please, rather than...well, normal, I guess.
Challenge accepted. Give me a month.  Edit: I've started. I've never used the AE suffix so much in my life.
I thought you said "moth", so I captured one.  Now I feel foolish
Nice one Gandalf.

Or an undub. I think the actor James earl jones dubbed over was Scottish.
Wasn't he from Birmingham?
West country i think, had a farrrrmer accent.
Nope american/cherokke 
whatever happened to the fan film of the original movie? "everybody does star wars." that was pretty cool 
On one condition... Ewan McGregor plays Obi-Wan.

Yarp.
He really came out of his shell in Game of Thrones. Plus that fella with an accent. 
You know [Rory McCann was the Scott's Porage man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tZ0LWGdTq0) here before all that fame?
I only learned about that after GoT. It's marvelous.
Technically no, not for this particular line. To maintain the secrecy of the twist, Prowse was given an alternative line (if I remember right it was "No, he [Obi-Wan] killed your father"), and Mark Hamill was privately told the actual line to react to.  Apparently Prowse didn't find out the twist until the premiere.
Haha fair play.

Well now I want a Scottish dubbed version of the original trilogy.
Being American, I looked at it and went “so the top part is some Gaelic joke I won’t get, skip that part” and was trying to figure out what the hand was groping. 
It's [Scots Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language)!

That's one of those things that, even though I know it's fake, I want to believe is real because it looks *so damn cool.*
It's urban planning isn't it.  Every town and town centre looks much the same. 
Did you guys know that the scottish bairn is quite similar to the scandinavian barn? Interesting.  When you leave the UK maybe you can come join the nordic countries.
> Did you guys know that the scottish bairn is quite similar to the scandinavian barn?  Scotland may be the child-obesity capital of Europe, but that's still a bit harsh.
Took me a second. haha. 
Hahahaha
Scots is littered with Scandi adoptions, as well as similarities to other languages (Kirk means the same in Scots and Dutch for example).  I quite like considering Scotland a Nordic country, don't see a reason why we can't. I think the aim on gaining independence would be to apply to the Nordic council as well.
My favorite example:  * ENGLISH: A child is crying * SCOTS: A bairn is greeting * SWEDISH: En barn ~~grytar~~ gråter
>En barn grytar  An [sic!] child is... stewing? potting?  Should be "Ett barn gråter"
Ugh. Which accent of The Pan-Nordic Language is it 'grytar' in again?
Yep! I love finding similarities like those!      **Scots**: Kens thoo a bairn that greets?     **Swedish**: Känner du ett barn som gråter?     **German**: Kennst du ein Kind das weint?     **English**: Knowest thou a child that cries?      (I do not vouch for the accuracy of any of these sentences! :D)    
It's kirkku is Finnish, kyrke in Swedish and kirke in Norwegian.   There's quite a few examples, For instance, "hoos" = "hus", "quine" = "kvinor"  Edit: kyrka 
Never heard the word kyrke, what does it mean?  
Church 
Aah yeah, though it is kyrka, Atleast in Stockholm swedish :)
It is kyrka, it was a typo on my part. Added an edit. 
Kirche in German.
I'm surprised Finnish is in there as it's not related very closely like the others.
Until 1809 (from the 1200s or so) Finland was literally the eastern half of Sweden. I'm surprised there isn't more influences than there is. 
My fiancé is Finnish and that's the only word she can come up with that's somewhat similar to Scots. 
[deleted]
In my defence, Finnish is fucking impossible to learn. 
[deleted]
My wife wants me to learn. 
Not because she's Finnish, just because she wants you to suffer?
That's what I think. 
Yup!
Maybe nae the border softies though, Dumfries and Galloway can go their own way.   */s*
It's kerk in Dutch, but close enough. 
In Dutch it's "Kerk" though.
Aye that's why I said means the same not spelled the same.
But.. Every word for church in different languages mean the same..
Are you just being pedantic to get on my tits? The pronunciation is the same.
Not really but close. Unless it's pronounced differently in Scottish than English.
Yes, if you go here: http://forvo.com/word/kerk/ that's pretty much exactly how it's pronounced here.
All the upvotes.
Does Scots have a word for helicopter, though?
Whirlybastirt.
> When you leave the UK maybe you can come join the nordic countries.  That sounds braw!
also brother is "brer", cry is "greet", good is "braw". There are a lot more examples but those are a few from the top of my head.
Brer could possibly stem from the Gaelic brathair (pron: brar or bra-her), bit closer than the Norwegian / Swedish bror. The other two are definitely Norse though. 
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0460  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/27625)
Yeah, Gaelic is still an indo-European language, so family terms like mother, father, brother, and so on will be similar in all of them. 
Quite a few! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Scots_terms_derived_from_Old_Norse
Scots and Scottish Gaelic are full of Norse words. bairn vs barn, (child), kirk vs kirke (church) etc. The [Scandinavian influences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Scotland) are a big part of our history and still influence our culture today in music, place names, personal names etc.
It's very common in Yorkshire due to Scandinavian occupation.
[Nah, it's from when we sacked York](http://i.imgur.com/xn4cYl4.png)
Pay reparations for Danelaw! You also left us to be fucked by William the Conqueror during the harrying of the North! Oh wait, you're a Scot, not a Dane, I thought we were friends!
Yorkshire was settled by Danes, whereas Scotland was settled mainly by people from modern day Norway and Sweden. [This map](http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zcf3r82/large) corresponds roughly with the parts of western and northern Scotland which were settled. 
Why settle the west coast of Scotland? Did the east have better defenses?
They thought Edinburgh was shite and all. 
If you look carefully I think Dundee is the centre of the viking exclusion zone.   No wonder.
Aw well, nae pehs fur the vikings then, ey? 
Transport to Canada and to the rest of the Americas was much easier.
A friend went to Denmark and a charity wanted money for "sma barns"
Små børn. (Phonetically, børn and bairn are probably really similar too, though, except or the R.)
Bairn is also a Geordie word.

Please cross post this to /r/tolkienfans and /r/lotr  The quality of your map is so high I dare not steal your karma.
Not a bad idea, I should really explore more of reddit..
Do you think you could make a map of Poland in the future? :)  I'm literally crying, your map is fucking incredible.  EDIT.  And dude.. DUDE...  Go to /r/mapporn with this  You are guaranteed to reach the front page and probably BBC in a weeks time or less...
Hopefully not, the more people see it the more they point out there are no mountains between Ayr and Glasgow.. Probably will do other countries though, was thinking id just do Europe in general or something like that.
Also, Ayrshire residents would be more put out that you forgot to include Ailsa Craig.
Was more of a conscious decision rather than forgetting, I was too lazy to doodle every island :(
More upset at the lack of Killie!
The Renfrew Heights aren't exactly the Himalayas but they do look quite tall when you're in the valley next to them. They just don't extend as far as you've put them, if you just erased the South-Eastern half with the big peaks it would look fine. Source: am looking at them right now.
True, it wouldnt take long to fix - but I do quite like how it looks now. If I extend to the whole UK ill be sure to do them properly next time.
Don't forget your Celtic cousins across the road =] 
I was actually going to do Northern and the Republic of Ireland at some point in the future, just for fun - but to be honest I haven't even visited either so it'd probably take a bit longer to get things right.

There is Dundonald Hill between Ayr and Glasgow. It's not very big, but it's something
Please, please, please do Norway. It would look amazing
Absolutely amazing you managed to create the European map in under a week, please create a video documenting your process to build these. So cool!

This is amazing, one thing, it's a bit weird to have Ben Nevis named and not Fort William. 
Hey I would really love to buy a print of this for my mom. She loves Tolkien and Scotland, and it would make a great gift. Any way you'd be willing to do that?
The map is available for free, click the link at the top comment to download the full size version. If you want you can print the file in whatever format you like.  There's lot of good online photo printing services, some will print onto canvas, others will frame it for you.  Just be mindful of size and resolution when printing.  And thanks for the interest, if you do print be sure to let me know how it looks!
Awesome thanks! Just wanted yo offer to buy it haha. But I will, I'll have it framed and everything and send you the pic so you can post it and get dat gud karma for it.
:D thats awesome, hope it comes out well in print!
Same. I'll have to track down a printer that will do it right. I'm thinking it would look best on either canvas or a faux parchment
Where the bloody hell is Shetland?!?!
forever in our hearts. Also, couldnt stretch the canvas any further due to the size of the background images i was using.
I guess you are forgiven hah, could have always rocked the floating box in the North sea but alas us and NZ seem to always fall off the edge! I would love a map of Shetland in this style, been toying with the idea of getting a watercolour map though as there is someone who does those locally which look quite nice, but then I get sucked back into looking at nautical charts and that's a whole other rabbit hole... 
I know what you mean, Ive been trying to decide on what i want to get printed and framed myself for my place - theres so many beautiful maps and charts to choose from :O  
I work at a law firm so come across lots of really old maps and plans, there are a few I have been very tempted to steal! Especially ones from the 1800s with all the old place names, its fascinating how they have changed with time. For example my family croft is called Huxter but found it on an old map labelled Hog Setter. Common Grazings records are strangely a gold mine for huge old maps. 
I can imagine - are you digitising them at all? Imagine there are ownership issues with a lot of that stuff though. I love them though, the detail and artistry is just amazing.
Just put an arrow pointing upward saying "Here be Vikings"

I've certainly slain a few orcs in my time
No, but you can have the original for free (see link at the top comment). You can print that file from whatever printing service is convenient to where you're from.

Impressive. I used to walk some of the hill passes with TLOTR in mind, and in particular I remember the Pass of Gaick (central Highlands, west of Cairngorms) as being strongly suggestive of the book's atmosphere - I even imagined I saw Gandalf waiting in the distance; but it was only a cairn. Another place was up Glen Tilt and down Glen Feshie, where  Ents could be imagined. (Geographical point: the 'Lowlands' on your map are actually the very hilly border uplands.)
I see your point about the lowlands, I could have split things up into smaller regions but it turned out to be quite difficult to find good spaces to place the labels - so I didnt really want to divide things up more than the general high and lowlands as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands  Completely agree about the general atmosphere on some of these hillwalks though :D
**Scottish Lowlands**  The Lowlands (Scots: the Lallans or the Lawlands; Scottish Gaelic: a' Ghalldachd, "the place of the foreigner") are a cultural and historic region of Scotland.  The Lowlands is not an official geographical or administrative area of the country. There are two main topographic regions: the Midland Valley (or Central Lowlands) and the Southern Uplands. The term "Lowlands" mainly refers to the Midland Valley.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Scotland/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

That map is an interesting example of how reality differs from our representations of it.
This is awesome, I want to get this printed up on canvas and put on my wall somewhere.
Aw, thanks :')
How the fuck does Kirkcaldy, a junkie infested nothing wasteland, get a mention but Dunfermline, a junkie infested ancient capital, doesn't?
Kircaldy sheriff court is famous. 
Mostly because Kirkcaldy is bigger, though i do agree Dunfermline would probably have been a better choice in retrospect from a historical point of view.
Is Kirkcaldy bigger? Dunfermline has a bigger population...
Apparently it does, googles first result showed old census data from 2001. Ah well.
Regardless this is still a very impressive map. Nice work
Whenever I drive past Dunfermline always seems to of added new houses.
Helps that all the new houses in Dunfermline are right by the motorway. It's weird, because the town centre on the other side is like two minutes from open countryside.
This is fantastic OP thank you! When I get this put onto a canvas I'll be sure to post a picture of it on my wall :)
That'd be awesome! Be sure to bear in mind the resolution though, it'll look kind of pixelly beyond a certain size.
It should be OK, it is actually quite a high resolution. I might get a framed print rather than a canvas as the canvas is likely to make it more blurry.
Ah, fair point ; I've never printed something like this before so Ive no idea how it would turn out - whether you'd need to tweak the brightness to bring out the shadows and contrast a bit more, i'm not really sure.
Yeah - I'll probably do a little bit of preprocessing in PS with the levels before I print it. I'm also fairly certain that knowing the level of attention that went into this that you'll be itching to do tweaks to it even now :p
pretty much, i mostly played around with the levels when doing cropped sections like the central belt. Its good fun to play with the colour, shadow and perspective correction a bit to create different effects.   It does end up making the original look quite flat and washed out though, but its a good starting point to work from I suppose.
I used to do that with random images all the time, especially flipping the colours.
But... but you left out my home the shetland islands. 
We Shetlanders demand recognition!
All 3 of us.
If you want recognition, then you should stand a bit closer. Can't even see you with a flipping telescope ;)
:( Sorry, the canvas wasnt big enough for the background I was using.
I'm an American and I just spent two weeks driving around Scotland for my 10th wedding anniversary. Everyone we met was super nice, 1500 miles Edinburgh Skye etc trip of a lifetime.   So this map is probably the greatest thing I've ever seen. You have a gift please keep painting. Well done 100x wow
I didn't even realise you could drive 1500 miles in Scotland. I should really get out of the city and explore the rest of the country.
:D Thanks!
In the Land of Newcastle where the Shadows lie.
I quite like how cheeky it was to include Newcastle in it haha. Should have put York there too...
Newcastle and Carlisle really shouldn't be in, kind of inconsistent with having nothing named in Northern Ireland. Ah well, I added it early and just left it.
Nah I quite liked it, considered it a nod to folk always saying that Geordies are basically Scots anyway.
Beautiful!
Good stuff.   I see  a "Great Wall" of some description might have been included. Geographically that might have been annotated as " of Mordor".  :O :)
Managed to slip kirkcaldy in I'm impressed. 
Looks like Westeros. 
thats very impressive 
Worth framing
Would love to see this done for Wales. I'd buy it on a canvas for the wall!

Sorry about that, the reference I was using seemed to only indicate towns/cities with populations over 40,000 or so on the mainland. I probably should have just added a few.
Just noticed...  why name a couple of places in England, but not Ulster?
Pretty much a mistake, I added them early and forgot to remove them after id decided to not add the names in Northern Ireland.
Ulster is best ignored.  :)

Will probably do the entire UK at some point, would just take a bit longer. But thanks :D
Was about to ask this. Brilliant work, you could definitely sell 'em.
Good to see the finished image, looks really awesome man! Thanks for posting!
Love these maps.   So cool.
Dude this is fucking amazing! Well done I really like it 
Very nicely done.  Brings to mind William Roy's 'Great Map'.  You might get a kick out of it:  http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=7&lat=57.1836&lon=-3.4134&layers=3&b=1  (works best in firefox for me)
Oh wow... that is seriously amazing. Interesting how Dunnottar Castle is randomly missing while others are there. Cant even imagine how long it took to overlay all those tiles on the map..
That's the mapping for the highlands only.  You can select the lowlands on the left hand side.  That site has many many more fascinating maps.  It's the result of an ongoing project to digitise the National Library's map collection.  edit: yes, that is very interesting that Dunnottar is missing!  Probably a mistake, but could be a deliberate omission.  It was a military survey, including only things of strategic value to the Kings forces (this was post-3rd Jacobite rebellion).  I think Dunnottar was already ruined by that time.  Maybe they figured it was of no interested to a 'modern' army.
Its really a fantastic effort - glad they're making history available in as many formats as possible.
I've lost days and days browsing those maps.   The OS Six-inch maps from the late 19th C. are my favourite.  Fun to compare to modern maps, to see what's changed and what remains...  http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&lat=56.9469&lon=-2.1999&layers=5&b=1
So cool seeing the photographs from the air in 1944-45. Thought my house was built after the war but I have been proven wrong.
Hey I live in a wee forest, nice.
Who wouldnt want that to be honest.
There are a lot of trees where I live so it's actually fairly accurate.
I've just ordered a print! I'll send you a picture once I've got it up in a cool frame. This is really fucking lovely. Well done!!!
Jesus this is beautiful!
Love this but the hills north of Stirling and west of Perth should be running west to east rather than south to north cause it looks like it's flat land between the two but the range of hills actually borders both towns. 
Iona must have sunk =(
:( RIP. Mostly just didnt want to draw every island, of which there are many. I tried to be relatively consistent on where the "cut off" point was.
Totally understandable, looks incredible!  Really great work.  
Would definitely buy a print of this if you offered it on a website or so (like etsy maybe? I don't really know)  If you ever do, please keep us updated. Brilliant work!
You can download it now and order a print from whatever site you like :D  Just bear in mind resolution and print size.  Thanks for the interest though!
Oh excellent! What do you think would be the max size for printing it without getting too much pixelation? I'm talking about the Google drive version
It depends really. If you use this as a guide it should give some insight: https://help.theprintspace.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/209214425-Print-size-guide-based-on-file-size  The file itself is approximately between 10 and 11 megapixels equivalent, though slightly odd actual dimensions.  Based on that it seems they wouldn't recommend more than 20 x 24 inches or whatever crops the best for the size of the image.
THANK YOU!
Ahh falkirk is on it! Awesome!
I live in the bit where it says Lowlands and it's hilly as fuck.
Parochial triggering. Has Kirkcaldy instead of Dunfermline. 0/10, would not use on my fantasy adventure to the Magic Kingdom of Fife.
D:
Nah, only kidding! 10/10, would definitely use on quest to defeat the evil linoleum forces of Kirkcaldy!
Ooh gorgeous, I do love some archaic styled maps, well done. Would not mind having this framed and hung on a wall.
This is amazing! I'm gonna get this printed...though it kinda feels like theft, I would be more than willing to pay for it. You really should think about selling them. Do other countries and make a business out of it. You'd make a fortune. 
Really appreciate that, but I've used resources from various different sources to make this (see the link in the top comment) so wouldn't be comfortable selling this, it's just a fun project inspired by some messing around for a friend's DnD campaign.  It would however be very cool to see it printed if anyone does decide to do that.
Yest I was thinking, how cool will it be to see our world map in game of thrones intro format... you have made the first step towards that.
Someone did this for Edinburgh already, they used to play it at Waverly Station:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulXa1novhI
Wow...cool
Great work. I would suggest maybe adding labels for Wester Ross and the Summer Isles, kinda fits in with the fantasy theme! 
Haha not a bad idea, game of thrones fans would appreciate it im sure.
Falkirk represent! Always good to see little ol' Falkirk getting a mention =D
This is the best thing I've ever seen on the internet. Top marks OP.
:O Thanks!
Reminds me of crusader kings 2
Perth: twinned with Mordor.
Mordors no a town ya plum its a region. Like Wales.
It was more of a joke. Shall we split the diff and say Perthshire.

You consider doing a version with the names in Gaelic? 
I could, but I mean, there arent many places which you would realistically expect to be in Gaelic aside from the west coast and islands.  Could be fun though, ill have a play around with it some time.
> there arent many places which you would realistically expect to be in Gaelic aside from the west coast and islands.  Doesn't stop the Scottish government...

Thats really interesting.. and really ambitious. Looks great though, might have a go at it later.  The fact that people would complain is just.. not unexpected, but still sad.
this is an absolute fucking belter but why no smaug style nessie drawing?
That'd be a great idea if I could draw :O But thanks!

I mostly put Arbroath and Montrose on because i travel between Edinburgh and Aberdeen a fair bit by train (plus Im from Arbroath), so Montrose stands out for me on the east coast.
This is fantastic. Any chance you could make a poster for this that could be bought for money?
Well, you can download it for free just now and print it from whichever photo printing service you want :D  But thanks for the interest!

Hey, a full Scotland map that shows Portree, me likey.
Wheres the famous free city of Millport 😭
Beautiful 
Just beautiful! I'm a cartographer and can't wait to plot this out & hang it up on my wall at work. I will make sure to add your screenname for proper credit. 
:O awesome - if you get it printed i'd love to see how it looks!
How could you use Kirkcaldy to represent the whole of Fife? You monster!  Nice map.
The North-East is missing its "Mordor" tag. 
Gaelic Ale Style
Not a single borders town on the map :( People live in the lowlands too you know !   Great map nonetheless
I would buy a print of this.
Where the trees are on the right of Loch Lomond is where Ben Lomond should be.
Love this, but disappointed in the lack of detail even though it should be minimal :( Also only the Clyde is named? Why not the Don/Dee/Spey?
Mostly due to lack of resolution and things started to look messy over time. The font choice doesn't work that well on the size needed to start labelling each river. You have a point about the consistency though, I mostly labelled the Clyde as that space is otherwise empty, whereas the other rivers would have labels overlapping other features.
I take it Northern Ireland is locked in the basement with no wifi.

holy fuck we are on the front page
There's HUGE interest in America..  was on the hourly ABC news headlines on American talk radio all afternoon today.  The Yanks know about their Scottish heritage..  just look at the names on their declaration of independence...  http://www.ushistory.org/DECLARATION/SIGNERS/index.htm  
American here. Not only are we quite aware of our Scottish heritage (thanks to many, many Scottish immigrants over the years leading to numerous ethnic Scots in the US, along with even more ethnic Irish), but America is always interested in people ~~revolting against~~ peacefully separating from ol' England, as we were the very first to get out of their clutches (and now look where we are!).
You got independence and fought the UK though, which includes Scotland. The whole anti-English vibe i'm seeing over Reddit on this subject is amazing, it's mostly from Americans too
We never thought of ourselves as fighting the Scottish, however. Primarily, we always think of the English and Germans (since Hanover was a possession of the British crown) being our enemies back then, with the Spanish and French on our side. The Scottish and Irish never even enter the picture.  Now, *did* we fight the Scottish? Almost certainly. But it's not what we remember. We remember the lobsters, redcoated English coming to take our money and such.
This is what I don't understand. It was the British Empire, not the English Empire. The Scottish, Welsh, English and even some Irish were all "redcoats", just the majority were English due to a bigger population. 
I'm only talking about our *perception* of it, not the reality. England and the UK are synonymous over here for less-worldly people (which is a large number of people).
Not to be offensive but if that perception is what's being taught in basic history classes across schools in America (it might not be, i have no idea) then that's a problem in itself 
It's not being taught, that's all. US history goes over our reasons for declaring independence, and then a basic rundown of how the war went. There's a little bit of the diplomacy involved, but it all revolves around which independent states were involved, not how the Scottish, Irish, Welsh, or shit, Cornish felt about it.  A lot of people forget things from high school after graduation if they didn't see it as useful. A lot of people saw history class as pointless, so they forgot it. This is true of every generation, so it's not a "kids these days" thing, either.
> Not to be offensive but if that perception is what's being taught in basic history classes across schools in America (it might not be, i have no idea) then that's a problem in itself  That's a big problem.  There's been an interesting book written about the topic titled [Lies my teacher told me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me) and the wildly inaccurate and often downright false things taught in US history classes. It's an interesting read.  US history classes, marginally more accurate than the History Channel.
got any links to news reports about  independence from the american news

Dear Redditors - i'm absolutely shocked with the amount of upvotes on this.  I'd just like to say that all i did was catch something on twitter that was being retweeted like crazy- i didnt make this graphic.    Can somebody figure out who actually made this , and we can give that person the love they deserve.  It's an awesome graphic and brought a lot of laughter and love around the world.  Thanks.
Its.  Sorry.
It is complicated, not it has complicated.  Headline is correct.
"changes it is Facebook status"?
My goof. I didn't even *see* that one.
In this situation both are correct.
Wrong.   Possessive pronouns do not have apostrophes. "Its" is like his, ours, theirs, and yours.
I knew the rule but never made the connection to ours, theirs etc. Seems so obvious now.
[deleted]
Clear and precise grammar, means that the content of a sentence can be absorbed more easily. The alternative is having to stop and ask "What is the author trying to convey here?" and that is a troublesome question that might lead to literary analysis and other cases of premeditated acts of applied humanities. And we surely don't want that, do we? 
That comma shouldnae be there.
I like to throw commas at a sentence from six feet of distance after I finish it, kinda like darts. 
Applies humanities you mean like in McDonald's 
[deleted]
<Insert slippery slope argument here>
[deleted]
Of course. And they should. I for one am no fan of following grammar for the sake of it. My rule is if it breaks grammar to make an intentional stylistic point, go for it. But in this case it was a mistake pure and simple. The break in grammar adds nothing to the sentence. So in this case it should be followed.
Change for the sake of change is not good change. Weakening the language by introducing ambiguity merely because you are too lazy to correctly use its or it's, is not a good change.
there is automatic translation in place for Welsh?
Grammar?
Aye, lad.
I think there had been a collective failure in both yes and no campaigns in a marketing front.

Hun in Ireland means something slightly different.
No, hun means "honey" in Ireland too, the *other* meaning is rarely ever used. 
I'll bow to your knowledge.  It's a word I'd preferably avoid in any case
You'd only ever hear *that* usage from the more hardline republican types.  It also wouldn't make any sense in this context.
I dunno, I've been called a hun enough times that when I see it written that way I think 'term of abuse'. I guess it just depends who you've had the misfortune to run into enough times.
"Hun" is definitely "honey" in Ireland ..  Irish here.   Mostly used by girls.   the Scottish "Hun" thing re Celtic vs Rangers is never used in normal everyday conversation/texting etc..
When you say Irish, do you mean Republic or Northern? I should have specified, I'm from the North.   I learned the word over here. I had it used against me over here. I'm not denying that it doesn't get nearly as much play as in Scotland, but it is used by the people who feel like it.  Although, the only person I get it from regularly is my girlfriend, who's definitely not attacking my political or religious views, so I'm not trying to say like it's only one way or the other.
i mean Republic.   Northern accent is a totally different thing...
"A c'mere hun, ya little dote'een ya, it wasn't meant to be offensive."
r u tryin 2 trigger me m8 omg hav a care
Ditto in Scotland. Unlike over the Irish Sea I've heard it a bit more often from weegeans.
Didn't know it was used in Ireland as well

Nah not really a "fuck the English" mood. More just "let us do what we want to do" kind of mood.  That's just me personally though.
I'm English. At first I was against the first referendum, but after Brexit, it's probably best for you guys to jump the sinking ship.  Fly free little bird :')
Upon hearing about the results of the EU referendum, my first thought was "well bye Scotland" 
Come with us.
No, I must stay.  Go on without me, i'll be fine... :c
And join another? great move.
I'd rather stay. It's better than jumping on an unsteady ship.
Agreed, I have nothing against the English. They voted for what they wanted after all, it isn't their fault we are stuck with it. I am more wanting to go off on our own.   Though to be fair, the picture is kinda accurate. I have no love for the union of the UK.
Yeah the whole anti-English thing is really what turns me off a lot of the indyref stuff, it was particularly bad on my Facebook feed around the referendum. Made me pretty sad. 
Sorry you saw any. I'm an English SNP Cllr. I'm about as "in" the YES camp as anyone else could be (with possible exception of Government ministers like, say Mike Russel, who is incidentally English). I didn't really see any. We had a few nutters claiming to be on the NO side calling us traitors etc. because as English folk we should be defending the Union or something, but aside from that it was remarkably good natured in terms of the race element... I think the #weAreScotland thing really brought that home this week that civic nationalism is not the same as ethnic nationalism. Sorry you saw anything that differs with my experience though.
There was definitely an anti-English mentality around the first referendum - not from the majority but it was absolutely present.
I didn't feel any myself. Most of the animosity is directed at Westminster itself thankfully, the place it should be directed at.
I'm English, in the most pro-Yes city and I didn't encounter it at all.
I've also never come across it.  And besides, in any collection of people, there'll always be idiots.  They don't count for the whole.
baelish is a cunt, i see us more like reek when he throws that woman off the bridge.   *that* was a freedom moment.  with her arrow point blank into sansas head, theon FINALLY comes to his senses and kills the bitch. and everyone lived happily ever after.

Or a good couple o' hundred thousand, the guy needs to finish the next book already. 
Eh the show really goes light on what happened to Theon.  Shit I'm surprised he didn't bite his wrists(when he still had teeth) till he knocked a vein and just bled out.
[deleted]
No but they could have made reference to the amount of time which was fucking forever in the books and Ramsey could have just listed off some of his favorite past 'punishments'
His torture went on a bit too long as it was, I thought - symptomatic of the writers' blatant stauner for Ramsay Bolton.  There's only so many cocks a man can have removed by a torturer, and most viewers would get the point with the first one.    In the books the torture isn't even "on-screen" from what I've heard - though maybe it is later, in Theon's point-of-view chapters.
The TV show had a massive erection for the Ramseys and related stuff for some reason.  My biggest complaint with the TV show actually isn't them changing things I understand some times when you adapt something you have to tweak things, but it's them fundamentally changing the feel, the TV show has a need to create badasses and to have a glib viciousness that just isn't in the books.  The TV show is like a traditional high fantasy thing, trying to be dark fantasy but just ending up in grim dark territory.
he got de-cocked, tortured, kept in a cage and his feelings hurt ALOT in the tv show, did worse happen in the book?
Umm having all of his teeth broken off at the gumline for eating a rat that crawled in his cage.  The fact the show doesn't really put into perspective how long he was tortured to become reek.  I'm at work so I can't quote anything
He was also flayed and has some fingees/toes chopped off IIRC
7 Fingers, a man can live with 7. 
You don't want to "go Marquis" with it though.  In the Marquis de Sade's stuff the early tortures are horrifying because they're believable - you can easily imagine a bunch of sadistic perverts dreaming them up, and innocents having to endure them.  By the time they start firing greased prostitutes out of cannons it just gets ridiculous - turns into an endless Monty Python sketch.  God knows there have been some bizarre torture methods in real life, and real folk have had to suffer them, but it's even harder not to go Marquis on the screen than on the page I reckon.  Subtlety isn't something the GoT writers are known for, but I think it's for the best that they left out some of Theon's travails.  Mind you, if they'd dropped the Sand Snakes in favour of eight more Theon-torture scenes, I wouldn't complain.
Comparing Scotland to a castrated bitch, bold move.
Its actually pretty accurate, when you think about the shit the Tories get up to.
Christ this blew up

\>tfw Wales gets away with it
Dunno man, the Irish had designs on Wales since the Anglo-Normans came and fucked it up for everyone.   Ideally you should try and be the power behind the throne. No-one ever suspects the Welsh...
> No-one ever suspects the Welsh...  Many a ewe might disagree. ;)  
There was no strong love of the EU in Scotland. Not until it became a stick to beat the UK with.
There wasn't much hate either to be fair. 
Fun fact, the approval ratings of the EU in Scotland jumped up 15% (50% to 65%) when the SNP made it clear that voting remain and getting dragged out would cause a second referendum.   Weird that.   Even weirder, this happened in the midst of the Greek crisis and the migrant crisis when approval of the EU was falling in basically every other EU country.   Real weird....  
Could be just that people started learning more about how it functions in the lead up to the EU Referendum and came to the conclusion its not as bad as the media portray it. In fact its a pretty good institution.
I'm in this camp, went from "EU?" to strongly remain. Mixed feelings about independence.
Bare in mind that the downside to staying in the UK is we are doomed to another thousand years of Tory rule, and if you think thtey're fucking us now, just wait until wefuck the next vote up and tell them 'Please sir, have you any more?'.  They will gut us.
Would you mind elaborating?
Consider how day 1 over the no vote was "E.V.E.L" (English votes for English Laws) followed by a Brexit vote. I can only imagine day 2 of a no vote this time around Mrs May will probably declare that we should consider E.V.A (English votes for all) and there would be a new royal prerogative to strap jets to the coast and fly us into space to get further away from the French.
Aye, I agree with this, a second No vote would be used by Westminister to try to dissolve any notion of "Scottishness".  Which is why either I hope we get what we want without a 2nd vote, or we have a well researched plan post-independence, with EU allies, and more people feel comfortable saying Yes.
I think perhaps a more likely outcome is a return to the status quo, honestly.  I think everybody would benefit with a proper plan, for both voting for independence and staying in the union. However we would not be able to get EU allies before voting. So that side is essentially scuppered.  I was heavy-yes before, now I intend to be a little more contemplative.
Same. I could take or leave the EU a year ago, but as soon as Brexit came up I learned exactly how much EU money got directly plowed into Scottish (and northern English) cities, especially for regeneration, in the past decade.  Like the £11m for Dundee's regeneration. Universities getting £88m/y with Glasgow Uni alone getting £20m over 2 years. The £175m Loan we got for building the M74 extension.  Sure, we don't get back as much as what we pay in, but it'd be a cold day in hell before any Tory government would replace that money like-for-like anywhere north of Watford.
How could you have been ambivalent/ignorant about the EU while being a part of it? Are you quite young, or something?
Could be.   Or it could just be a cynical attempt at a second referendum. Plenty of people in this sub admitted they were voting just to trigger a second referendum. 
Thought pre-ref you guys were all saying that those people you were talking about were voting leave to trigger it.  So you're saying you think the support for the EU is even higher?
That wouldn't make any sense. The only way a second IndyRef would happen was if Scotland voted remain and the rUK voted leave, resulting in a leave.   I'm saying more people voted remain in Scotland just to trigger the conditions the SNP set for a second referendum. 
No you're right it wouldn't (and didn't make sense) but on here unionists before the EU referendum peddled that as cold hard fact that significant numbers of SNP voters were doing just that.  Now the vote went the other way it looks like the opposite will start be peddled. canny win.  Though come on, you realise how tinfoil hatted your suggestion is too right?  
Nope, they didn't.   If you think they did, then link me to a comment or thread that proves you right.   [Here's my proof that Indy Supporters were promoting remain to get a second referendum.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/4nnqu9/the_indyref2_guide_to_voting_in_the_eu_referendum/)  >But if your main consideration is how best to bring about Scottish independence and you’re not overly fussed about the status of the UK as a whole within the EU, and you believe that the EU referendum is best approached as a proxy referendum which can help bring about a second Scottish independence referendum, then you should vote to remain if you live in Scotland, and vote to leave if you live elsewhere.
/u/halk /u/demoneggy   As the first names that came to mind for this sub as regulars on the opposite side of the divide, did or didn't tons of people on this sub pre (EU) referendum claim that there were people who were pro-Independence and pro-EU planning on voting out in the hopes of driving up the overall leave result to engineer the situation we ended up with (Scotland votes in, rUK votes out)  Sorry /u/heknarf, I cba trawling through months old threads to find the off the cuff remarks about what an epidemic it was that will likely be brushed off by your fine self anyway.
There were a few people who claimed others were doing that, (I think /u/Halk brought it up a few times), but I personally never met a single person who said *they* were doing that. Because clearly it would be a stupid idea.   So yeah, you're right, there were people claiming that was fairly common (or at least not unheard of), but /u/Heknarf is also right, that that would be dumb. And as far as I can remember, the majority of people in this site were quick to point that out, any time it was brought up...
I brought it up because I know two independence supporters who voted to leave the EU. One because he did want to leave the EU and another because he saw it bringing independence closer.
Ok, I'm putting this down to a win for me because I found evidence of my claim and you found diddly squat. 
Ah, the old post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
Indeed. I feel we were remarkably ambivalent towards it, in general.   Something polarised it though.
To be fair, we all were.  I think many people in the Remain camp would freely admit they are surprised at how strongly they feel about Europe after the fact. 
Almost as though it was just a normal thing and not the source of all our ills 
Ambivalent means to have conflicting feelings, so you can still feel very strongly about something and be ambivalent 
"no strong love", that is because there has been no huge problem with the EU, simple as that.   There are problems with the EU, but what they give us is overwhelming to what we are complaining about.
I've written this on here before..so sorry if its a repeat!!  I grew up in the west in the 80s. The first time I tasted Edam cheese was from an EU foodbank after my father was made redundant. When Ravenscraig was closed, Westminster left the place to rot. It was the EU that stepped in and tried to help. Many Ravenscraig workers, and others in the general area, like me, were helped by EU funded course. Myself, the EU paid to put me through an HNC and also training in a speciality.   I think if you grew up in that area at that time, you'd be more than ambivalent towards the EU
Its not really like the EU gave you that money, I dont think the likes of Lithuania and Hungary paid for that, more like your own taxes went to poorer nations and a bit come back to you.
This was long before Eastern European countries were members..IIRC the HNC was 3 years after the wall came down.  The point still stands though. The Tories closed down businesses and ran away leaving Scotland to its fate. The EU designated west of Scotland as a deprived area and pumped cash in. It may have been my own taxes coming back..but not from Westminster, It didn't give a fuck
Nobody had ever asked how people feel before.
Polling before the first independence referendum consistently showed euroscepticism at about the same level in Scotland and rUK.
Gonna need a link or something
> Since the early 1990s BSA has regularly asked people what they think Britain’s long-term policy towards the EU should be by presenting respondents with five options ranging from leaving the EU altogether all the way to forming a single European government. While in the most recent survey only 22% say Britain’s long-term policy should be to leave the EU, as many as 43% say that Britain should remain in the EU but reduce the EU’s powers. Taken together these figures suggest that nearly two-thirds (65%) of British voters would like the UK to be less intertwined with the EU than it currently is. In other words, Euroscepticism across Britain is widespread, as indeed BSA has consistently found to be the case in recent years.  > But what about Scotland? SSA has asked exactly the same question of its respondents since 1999. It has consistently recorded lower levels of Euroscepticism than its sister British survey. However, the most recent (2015) survey puts the level of Euroscepticism in Scotland at 60%. This is the highest level ever recorded by SSA (as recently as 2013, only 48% fell into the sceptical category) and is just five percentage points behind the level recorded across Britain as a whole.  - from http://whatukthinks.org/eu/is-scotland-really-keen-on-the-eu/  See also the lovely chart at http://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/what-do-you-think-britains-long-term-policy-towards-eu-membership-should-be-2/ - just 10% want to either work towards a single European government or to increase the EU's powers in the most recent survey cited (2014), while fully 41% wanted to reduce the EU's powers with a further 17% wanting to leave outright.
What were the figures?  
There's some people in the indy movement who'd swear undying fealty to ISIS, Mugabe, Kim Jong-Un and Ronald McDonald, if it'd get Scotland independence.  Although to be fair I can't see the EU as being a big fan of independence the way you or I perceive it.  I'd no fancy Scotland becoming a province of the United States of EUtopia, but everyone's got their own particular ideas on what indy would be.  
Nae bother pal
And there are some Unionists who have spent so long on their knees that Westminster could send in the fucking army and blow up Holyrood and they'd shrug their shoulders say they deserved it or bend over spread their rectums and shout c'mon and have me big boy
> There's some people in the indy movement who'd swear undying fealty to ISIS  You've got it the wrong way round.  According to the press in 2014, it was ISIS that swore undying fealty to the indy movement.  Remember?  http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scottish-independence-link-to-isis-scots-hostage-1-3534191

Truest thing I read today!.....just replace the 'UK' with 'English' and you'll be right on point!
I'm getting really tired of this chip on the shoulder some English people have developed where everything in Scotland is apparently a slight against them.
Funny that, since my parents are English and vote SNP too. Get that out of your head right now.
It's not uncommon. No matter where you are from once you realise that if you are living in Scotland we don't have a voice you vote SNP.
I have English friends who live in England and wish they could vote for the SNP.
Let's not act like there aren't idiots out there that have a strong anti-English sentiment. 
Who is acting like that?  it's that the tiny tiny amount like that are blown out of all proprtion on one side by English unionists and for that matter nationalists who want to justify the way they're going on about Scotland at the moment and then on the other side Scottish Unionists who feel if they can just make Scottish nationalists into enough of a bogeyman even if not justified then somehow that makes it alright to get all riled up at them.  This tarring of Scottish Nationalists entirely unfairly with the anti-English trope is at the point where most people across the constitutional divide see it for what it is and quietly mutter to each other about what pillocks the people pushing that narrative are.

Metaphorically. In context of both referenda it's more "get tae fuck". Should have been the Union Jack, though.
They're doing a pretty good job of their own demise all by themselves. We just want their government to let go of our feet.
As opposed to Scotland being dragged to its demise by an abusive union. Scotland needs independence to make its own way in the world the way it's citizens see fit not dragged into wars by megalomaniacal Westminster governments more interested in if the fucking  queen gets a new boat than the fact we are destroying Syria.   Loads of moderate English feel this way too so it's not beating the English it's trying to divorce an abusive relationship with Westminster.
Abusive Union?  Scotland benefitted MASSIVELY from the British Empire for one. 
>Scotland benefitted MASSIVELY from the British Empire for one.   Did it though?    I'm left wondering how it ended up poorer per capita than Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and all those other nearby independent states (even the Republic of Ireland) who obviously *didn't* benefit MASSIVELY from the British Empire?
Scottish GDP per capita: $43,410 UK GDP per capita: $41,787  Looks like Scotland is richer than the rest of the UK on average. 
So even the rest of the UK didn't benefit particularly from the British Empire, and ended up poorer per capita than all the small and medium-sized independent states across the north west of Europe? Not much to boast of really, is it?  To rule a quarter of the globe, control the labour forces and natural resources of whole continents, and maintain a stranglehold on all the world's most important trade routes, only to end up with a citizenry poorer than Denmark's...  It suggests to me that it might not have been worth it, and maybe the Empire wasn't all it's cracked up to be.   
I don't know why you keep banging on about the Empire, it's hardly relevant to modern day life, or indeed this thread.   > a citizenry poorer than Denmark's  I'm not sure why you think having roughly the 20th best GDP per capita PPP in the world is a failure, particularly when half of the countries above the UK attained that due to either oil wealth or being a tax haven (consequently having a very poor gini coefficient).    I'm also not sure why you're completely discounting the fact that the empire ended decades ago, and that growth has varied since then, and that other top countries have an abundance of natural resources and the legacy of an empire. And whilst the empire ended a while ago, let's not forget that in its dying days it was costing the UK more money than it made.   > maybe the Empire wasn't all it's cracked up to be  The Empire powered the end of piracy and the slave trade, started and spread the industrial revolution, spread democracy and the rule of law globally, promoted free trade, stable economics and multiculturalism, and exported many sports. Ultimately, it also paid to free Europe from the clutches of dictatorships multiple times, as well as infrastructure both in the UK and the Realms. Sure then empire had its downsides, but let's not pretend it was a failure, especially when compared to our neighbour's colonial legacies. 
> I don't know why you keep banging on about the Empire, it's hardly relevant to modern day life, or indeed this thread.  I didn't bring it up, I was replying to another poster who mentioned the subject.  I don't like to see the Empire being portrayed as if it was economically beneficial to the average British citizen, since at the very height of our imperial power and wealth we were still forcing kids up chimneys and a goodly portion of the imperial capital subsisted in slum conditions, nevermind the rest of the kingdom.  I think the Niall-Ferguson-inspired rehabilitation of Empire is potentially dangerous and needs knocking down where it appears.  > The Empire powered the end of piracy and the slave trade  It also practiced and facilitated these things for centuries, until they became more profitable to our competitors than to us.  At that point it was time for a clampdown.  >started and spread the industrial revolution, spread democracy and the rule of law globally, promoted free trade, stable economics...  None of this was a stated aim of the Empire until pretty late in the game, and even then it was mostly a cover story for the economic exploitation of our overseas possessions.  Little of it was ever intended to be of benefit to the native populations we had conquered or conned into servitude.  It would've been clearly against the interests of the Empire itself to make it's holdings feel capable of self-government, for example by letting them exercise democracy or the rule of law in any ways that were outwith our control... so we didn't.    The East India Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. aren't the best examples of free trade I can think of, but India is a particularly good example of the stable economics we promoted; under the British Raj the Indian economy remained stagnant for an entire century.    >it also paid to free Europe from the clutches of dictatorships multiple times  The Bourbons were as dictatorial as Napoleon, more so in some ways.  If you mean the Kaiser and Hitler then fair enough, though I'm not sure their downfalls were purely (or even mostly) down to the British Empire.  >Sure then empire had its downsides, but let's not pretend it was a failure  It was.  >especially when compared to our neighbour's colonial legacies.   Fair point, they were terrible too, in most cases worse than ours (and they failed in their aims as well).
> I didn't bring it up, I was replying to another poster who mentioned the subject  Mate, scroll up. You replied to me when I pointed out that Scotland is better off than the rUK. I wasn't talking about the empire, you evidently just wanted to complain about it to someone.   > I think the Niall-Ferguson-inspired rehabilitation of Empire is potentially dangerous and needs knocking down where it appears  Don't know who the hell that is, but the empire wasn't evil, it simply was. Just because it didn't improve every single thing, doesn't mean that it was bad overall.   > It also practiced and facilitated these things for centuries, until they became more profitable to our competitors than to us  Slaves were still profitable when the Royal Navy enforced the ban on the slave trade actually. It was entirely in Britain's interests to keep going. As for piracy, you may be conflating that with privateering, which was a very different thing, despite appearing the same.   > a cover story for the economic exploitation of our overseas possessions  The empire was focussed on money, yes, but not wholesale looting. British merchants practised mercantilism (like everyone else in the world) and gave themselves favoured status. As for the other money, it was simply a question of taxes going to the Brittanic crown instead of another warring kingdom.   > clearly against the interests of the Empire itself to make it's holdings feel capable of self-government, for example by letting them exercise democracy or the rule of law in any ways that were outwith our control... so we didn't  Are you ignoring the infrastructure and the fact that, for example, most Indian Princes weren't annexed by GB? The British generally let Indian govern itself, and only took charge of foreign affairs and defence. Remember, the object of the empire was money, not conquest.   > under the British Raj the Indian economy remained stagnant for an entire century  The British Raj wasn't concerned with economic growth, as it wasn't in control of that policy. It was concerned with trade and defence, local rulers dealt with that. And since it wasn't worthwhile for them to industrialise, they didn't bother. If you look at the Indian railways, the British built them to help with military purposes, and to stimulate industry, and one that became a symbol of an industrial modernity. Under British rule, the rural economy (75%) increased its post-tax income from 27% to 54%, £400million had been invested in infrastructure, irrigation and industry, and the amount of irrigated land increased by a factor of eight. Besides this, the British regime did not make any sharp breaks with the traditional economy, most control being left in the hands of regional rulers. The old Mughal rates of taxation were left unchanged, and were still raised using local administrators, thanks to the heavy cooperation with Indian elites.   Still, I was quite clearly referring to the Commonwealth countries that have kept ties with the UK, all of whom have done well post-independence and remained strong economies. But thanks for bringing up India, I enjoy telling people how the sub-continent benefited from British rule and peace.   > The Bourbons were as dictatorial as Napoleon, more so in some ways  The later Bourbon, who was an idiot, yes. But at least he didn't try to annex a whole continent. Repeatedly.   > I'm not sure their downfalls were purely (or even mostly) down to the British Empire  I wasn't referring to the Kaiser Wilhelm II at all actually. But it's true to say that the British Empire did indeed stand alone against Hitler for a while, despite Hitler having no intention of conquering the UK.   > It was.   Most people formulate arguments to back up their positions.   > Fair point, they were terrible too, in most cases worse than ours (and they failed in their aims as well).  In most cases? I'd say in all but one. Everyone but the British and the Dutch were quite frankly terrible towards their new subjects, and you only have to look at the ex-colonised countries today to see which ones were successful and which weren't. As for aims, they all tended to succeed, since, you know, they all made money. 
"We pillaged half the world but I gave you some of the spoils so, y'know, we're in this together now."
Notice how The British Empire expanded astronomically with the addition of Scotland.  The Empire was built on Scottish ingenuity and English money.  Many many Scottish people held positions of power all throughout the Empire. Most high-end positions in all areas of colonial government etc were Scots. This was due in part to Scotland's superior education system at the time.  To act as if we did nothing is white-washing history.   Why do you think Glasgow was the Second City of The Empire?
Aye, I don't disagree with you at all; Scotland is massively culpable for the atrocities of the Empire, and to claim otherwise is disingenuous. (Though I believe Dublin was considered the Second City prior to the nineteenth century, just as a point of interest.) Nonetheless, there are still ways that Scotland contemporarily gets, and historically got, the short end of the stick, so while calling the union "abusive" might be too simplistic, it's not entirely inaccurate in principle.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_city_of_the_United_Kingdom  Seems since the 19th century Glasgow got the title. However many different places claimed the title.  I know what you're saying but a lot of the time it was only certain areas that got shafted. The clearances for example. You could look at the Jacobite Rebellion, more Scots were against the Jacobites than were with them. 
> Many many Scottish people held positions of power all throughout the Empire. Most high-end positions in all areas of colonial government etc were Scots. This was due in part to Scotland's superior education system at the time.  A global empire is also a good way to get rid of troublesome parts of the domestic population.  You can throw potential troublemakers out to the four corners of the earth and get them earning for you, and they'll send money back even if you starved them out of their own home or deported them to start with.  For a while anyway.  
>Scotland being dragged to its demise by an abusive union.

Orwell wrote extensively on the British left's self loathing.  >moderate English  beyond a joke that you even think in such terms.
Russia and Assad wouldn't need to be doing anything if we hadn't royally fucked the whole region and then funded ISIS and Syrian rebels.

do you not think it's legitimate though? A lot of English people are rightly pissed off at the Scottish exceptionalism and superiority promoted by the SNP
what kind of superiority would that be?
The constant virtue signalling of 'we Scots are such a progressive forward thinking people whereas the english are nasty old racists, this can be proven by the fact that so many English people voted for UKIP and Brexit, they're all narrow minded xenophobes who want teh Empire back, we Scots are so much different, were better than them'.  It's utter bs. I'm a Scot and I'm very interested in different countries and cultures, speak foreign languages, have been to many countries all over the world, whenever I'm back in Scotland I have to do a double take at the amount of insularity and parochialism, ignorance of other countries and cultures, not speaking foreign language. I've even lived in England much of my life, and yes plenty of English people are narrow minded and ignorant, but proportionately it's the same as in Scotland. Scotland is not fucken different at all, Scots aren't any more 'progressive' or exceptional than other parts of the UK. it's a fucking circlejerk and the SNP have simply memed the idea of Scotland being progressive into existence- simply to create the idea that they are different...aka have more 'superior' progressive values, for the obvious intention of saying Scots are too good for the UK.
>'we Scots are such a progressive forward thinking people whereas the english are nasty old racists, this can be proven by the fact that so many English people voted for UKIP and Brexit, they're all narrow minded xenophobes who want teh Empire back, we Scots are so much different, were better than them'.  See, I'm an SNP supporter and I don't believe any of that.  >it's a fucking circlejerk and the SNP have simply memed the idea of Scotland being progressive into existence- simply to create the idea that they are different...aka have more 'superior' progressive values, for the obvious intention of saying Scots are too good for the UK.  I don't think many SNP supporters think that the Scots are "too good" for the UK; I think most feel that Scotland gets a raw deal from Westminster.  I think it's undeniable that there's a greater proportion of xenophobic UKIP voters in England than there is in Scotland.  I happen to think that's because immigrants are nearly always the first ones to be blamed in times of economic hardship; but in Scotland we have the unusual luxury of being able to blame a government for whom we didn't vote, i.e. we have the easy option of blaming the Tories.  I don't think it's really this tribalistic, moral superiority thing you suppose. 
ok, well in which case I guess you are less deluded than most of the loony nats i've met  >I think most feel that Scotland gets a raw deal from Westminster.  yeah but this is the thing I'm trying to say- Scottish exceptionalism assumes that it's unique to Scotland.Most English/welsh/NI people feel *exactly* the same way. they hate the Westminster elite just as much. We all feel we get a raw deal from Westminster. similarly, anti metropolitan feeling extends to many other countries, most provincial French and Germans despise Paris and Berlin respectively. tldr, it's not unique.  >I think it's undeniable that there's a greater proportion of xenophobic UKIP voters in England than there is in Scotland.  I don't think so at all- for a start scotland is waaaaay more homogenous than england, English people have to deal with things like Islamic extremism and high crime rates from certain ethnic minorities , if anything I'm not surprised more english people are 'xenophobic'. Secondly- no one talks about Scotland secret shame, the vast amount of pure anglophobia that still exists within a small subset of the Scottish population, that has been swept under the carpet by the SNP, but are still there, as English relatives of mine in Scotland have experienced.  just as people have been saying 'not all brexiters are racist, but all racists voted for brexit', not all scotnats are racist anglophobes, however all the racist anglophobe Scotnats voted yes/SNP. Scots simply seem to be too uncomfortable to confront the massive Anglophobia that underpins a lot of independence support  >I happen to think that's because immigrants are nearly always the first ones to be blamed in times of economic hardship; but in Scotland we have the unusual luxury of being able to blame a government for whom we didn't vote, i.e. we have the easy option of blaming the Tories.  perhaps, though furthering what I said above, Scotland is much more homogenous than England, so it's easy to be 'progressive' about migration when it's not affecting your wages or public services. however, even the majority of Scots want immigration reduced.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-31800374  >I don't think it's really this tribalistic, moral superiority thing you suppose.   Fair enough, I disagree. I know too many nats in the flesh and cybernats on social media.
> I don't think so at all  and then a single line later:  >if anything I'm not surprised more english people are 'xenophobic'.  So which is it? Are they proportionally more xenophobic or not? 
.....So which is it?  ok, let me clarify-- I think the definition of xenophobia/racism has gone too far to cover perfectly legitimate views that criticise religious/cultural practices within a community, or economic and social cohesion effects of immigration.  which is why I used 'xenophobic' in inverted commas- because to me what progressives consider xenophobia often isn't.   as for out and out full on racists, yes I don't think that there is any difference between the number in Scotland or England.
> Most English/welsh/NI people feel exactly the same way. they hate the Westminster elite just as much. We all feel we get a raw deal from Westminster.   Then help us remove the source of their power over us - which is *the political Union*.  
Switch English to Europeans, Scottish to British and SNP to Tories/UKIP and you are closer to the mark
not remotely comparable as Europe isn't a sovereign nation, the UK is.  And anyway I think in the long run history will look more favourably on the UK- by voting Brexit we are the first member nation to tacitly reject the federalist path of 'ever closer union'. The Brussels elites might be upset but all over Europe there is a massive grassroots unrest against a Federal EU.
Please take me too :(
Haha , I like it  Can't say I love the EU either tbf but an independent Scotland in the EU would be so much better than being in the UK, least voters in say France couldn't force upon us a government we ourselves didn't vote for.
What would be "better", specifically?  We'd likely need fairly brutal tax increases equivalent to doubling income tax or VAT, or spending cuts equivalent to cutting 80% of the health budget, to get our finances roughly into line with where they'd need to be as an EU nation (other small EU nations like Sweden and Denmark have governments taking 45-50% of GDP in tax, compared to the ~40% that ours takes, so it's not as though we're particularly unusual - we just have more comfortable tax rates at the moment because we're part of a larger entity, ie the UK).
> We'd likely need fairly brutal tax increases equivalent to doubling income tax or VAT, or spending cuts equivalent to cutting 80% of the health budget, to get our finances roughly into line with where they'd need to be as an EU nation  No, we wouldn't need any of that to be an EU nation.  Are you thinking of the convergence criteria for joining the Euro?  That's different.
Nope, the Stability and Growth Pact which applies to all EU members.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact
It's interesting to note from your link that only 6 of the 28 EU member states actually met the criteria of the SGP (in 2011, when the graphic is from).  The UK was in breach of it.  Even Belgium (Brussels) was in breach of it.  It may apply to all EU members, but it clearly doesn't apply to them all equally (Germany and France have been consistently in violation) or inflexibly - Poland, Croatia. 
If you don't value sovereignty you'll never understand I'm afraid. I already 40% tax, I'd happily double that for sovereignty. 
You'd pay 80% tax for a feeling of 'sovereignty'? That's fascinating. Why?
It's not a feeling of sovereignty, it is sovereignty. Because money isn't everything, I've been poor most of my life, I've scraped and I've struggled but now I'm decently well off. I got help from the systems that the current scum in government are trying to destroy, my mother would be dead if it weren't for the health service the current scum in government are trying to destroy,  I'd like to see Scotland get the government they voted for, with policies designed specfically to help the people of Scotland and if that means putting my hand in my pocket and paying more in taxes then so be it. As it stands I have my doubts it would be anywhere near as bad as some make out but fucks knows, all I know is that I'd rather roll the dice and try than be hitched to a Tory government for the next decade or two.
See, to me that sounds just like an anti-Tory, left wing point of view. Which is fair enough (I'd agree with most of it), but it's not really about sovereignty, is it?  What if an independent Scotland had a right wing government, and rUK had a left wing government at some point in the future. How would you feel about that?
It wouldn't matter, all that matters is that Scotland only gets the government it wants when it votes broadly in line with what England wants. There is an democratic imbalance that only independence or at the very least full fiscal autonomy can fix. I'd actually fully expect Scotland to end up with a slightly right of centre government post independence and I'd accept that although my personal preference would be economically centrist , socially very liberal.
You *do* realise that in a hypothetical independent Scotland there will be divisions, and some areas won't "get the government they vote for", right?
Doubtful since our voting system is far more representative than what passes for democracy in the UK and I'd hope that we'd move to an even better system once we can ditch the system we have for Holyrood.
Which country's system would you choose to emulate? I'd like to take a closer look.
I think the Irish system is good, similar size country to ours, using STV
That's fine to want independence just because that's what you want.   Whether it'd be a good idea, eeeeh. But everyone's entitled to their feels before reals. 
Nationalism.... not even once.
I've been both unionist and nationalist but really as a unionist I was just a nationalist of a different sort. Like most unionists. I'm rather much more happy being a Scottish nationalist with a internationalist bent 
It's very unlikely that an independent Scotland would be able to join the EU. The deficit's too big already (9.5% of GDP; EU members have to be 3% or lower) and would only get bigger if Scotland became independent.
I think that would be more a problem of joining the Euro than the EU. , countries are obliged to join the Euro ONCE they meet the requirements, Croatia joined the EU with a deficit higher than 3% and haven't joined the Euro, granted not as high as Scotland's but it certainly doesn't seem to be a deal breaker.
Neither does Poland for that matter.
Yeah when Poland joined the EU in 2004 their deficit was certainly above 3%, I picked Croatia mainly because I don't think the rules existed (the one that's begat this myth about Scotland not getting into the EU because of budget deficit) when Poland joined  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/poland/government-budget  From looking at it after the joined the EU their deficit went steadily down until the financial crisis and has been getting better since, all while being in the EU but not the Euro..
Poland is a strange one as its managed to defy the odds and avoid recession fairly well since joining the EU. From all the interviews I've seen with various Polish politicians, I doubt they have any real intentions of joining the Euro which I think is good sense. The Euro has been a bit of a disaster as no country has the ability to really adjust anything for their benefit of their economy.  
Fair enough, didn't know that about Croatia. 
It's true that Scotland's deficit needs to be reduced, and it's a good point.  That's actually what I want to hear from the SNP - how they're going to do it.  It's worth bearing in mind that Ireland slashed its deficit from 32.3% of GDP to 2.3% of GDP in 5 years.
Its important to remember WHY we have a deficit.   The vast majority of that money is being channeled into road and rail infrastructure, improving schools and hospitals. Its reasonably temporary and necessary spending to see us through the long term. It looks bad in the short term and most governments dont like spending on these things because they KNOW it looks bad.   Its also important to realise that it is an absolutely tiny amount next to the UK's war spending, which has no tangible benefits for anyone, and might be argued, is a debt that should wholly be owned by Westminster alone.
> The vast majority of that money is being channeled into road and rail infrastructure, improving schools and hospitals.  Actually the vast majority was borrowed due to the financial crisis. The UK deficit was £20bn in 2005, £50bn in 2009, and £103bn in 2010.  That money went into slowly unwinding our financial position, not in building five times as many roads or hospitals as normal.
Say it with me.   *The EU doesn't have deficit limits on membership, that's the Euro area, they aren't the same thing*.  
I'm pretty sure you're wrong. The Stability and Growth Pact applies to all member states - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact
It may apply to all states but not all states apply it. An important distinction.  Why is Denmark not in the Euro? It signed all the treaties, it meets all the criteria, it doesn't have a specific opt out and all those points have been true for a lot longer than the minimum terms outlined in the various Euro convergence stuff.  The answers dead simple - the EU has absolutely no mechanism to **force** its members into adopting a currency because the EU ultimately *is* its members and if it was so stupid enough to try Denmark would just deliberately miss the convergence criteria and fuck these hypothetical fantasy dictators with their own rules.  At any rate it's the convergence criteria - and trying to conform to it within the single currency - that's causing the contraction of members below the olive oil / butter line. If the Euro is to survive the convergence criteria has to be the first thing out the door.  The entire EU can't be net exporters like Germany, somebody somewhere has to take on debt to buy all this shit.
Denmark DOES have a specific opt-out from joining the Euro https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union
You're a smart cookie you. Now do Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic (Czechia?), Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden. 
No, they don't, as you know. I didn't say anything about the Euro in the first place though, just EU membership.
>Why is Denmark not in the Euro? It signed all the treaties, it meets all the criteria, it doesn't have a specific opt out  lol.  You are so badly misinformed it's funny.
Ah come on how was I to know Sweden has a Euro opt out eh? Doi!
DENMARK ya fanny. You done it again!
Ah balls, don't know how 'cause I love Saab - Go Bulgaria!
Here's an idea! All the self-hating Scots who want out the EU move to the South of England and we'll take all the folks up from England who want to remain. It's a win-win. 
So, 48% of UK moves to Scotland? Sweet.
They won't "send us their best".    Yes, that *was*  /J . :)     
Everyone here is always saying scotland needs more immigration.
Kinda disappointed no ones asked this yet...which means im SUPER out of the loop...whats this from :(
Game of Thrones.
My sweet summer child
As an Englishman who cannot believe the idiocy of over half his country can I come join please? 
Join away. This to me would be a more successful type of British Union, let each home nation choose their own politics, people can choose to live in the place they feel most comfortable with.
Doesn't solve the issue of my home nation being a bunch of idiots who don't know what's good for them.
I really wouldn't say the feeling is that sort, definetly not that strong.  It's more for a lot of us one is a fairly obstructionist union the other is more like a guiding hand.
Still, it's a laugh 'innit.
meh, I preferred the queen in the North shitposts.
So when do our beloved Scots leave the UK and join back the EU? Is there a date?   - An interested German
Not yet, it's still up in the air
As a Londoner: Can we join you?
As a Yorkshireman, please do. The whole United Kingdom pays taxes for your benefit, Northern infrastructure is fucked, especially in Yorkshire. Our roads are filled with potholes, our trains are 32 years old (pacers) in the town I live in. You have a higher quality of life, just because you're from the South, and because Westminster is on your doorstep. I'm sick of you pompous twats, you'd be fucked without the rest of the country, you'd have nobody to pay your taxes, and nobody to fund your dying city. 
Bradford checking in, don't really have anything to say about what you said above but just wanted to acknowledge a fellow yorkshireman. Ey'up.
Wakefield here, West Riding best Riding.
Now then!
Oh... we're sorry?
It does make sense to keep the torches and pitchforks as far from your own door as possible
To be fair London generates enough tax revenue to fund its self as well as most of the UK. 
Haha, it does not at all; there's no empirical evidence to back that up. No offence, but that's a kind of delusional belief.
Lothian is Anglo-Saxon, Scotland is just confused due to it's multiple-personality syndrome. 
Naw pal, thats rubbish. I'm from Lothian and that is, lackin a better word, pish.
* [Kingdom of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Northumbria)
* [Kingdom of Scotland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Kingdom_of_Scotland_Map.PNG).
Please read the entry, it is very important regarding the history of Lothian and Northumbria in general, and indeed for the rise of the Scots language.  Also:  Kingdom of Scotland - Lothian and Strathclyde **incorporated**, [Treaty of York 1254](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_York)
Ok, I will do.
Yes, Lothian was eventually annexed by the kings of Scotland, but its people remained ethnically English and didn't come to be considered "Scots" until long afterwards.
OK.
My uncle in America had multiple-personality syndrome.  He was good people though.

If you value independence why would you want to be more greatly involved with the union that has only ever sought to take power away from members?  Sovereignty is only ever ceded to the EU, it is never returned. The exact opposite is true for the UK over the past few decades.  Pretending to love the EU has just become a tool for shitting on the UK with, I don't think there is much legitimate love for it. I'm not saying Scotland hates the EU by any means, just that we are fairly indifferent to it because it hasn't done anything massively wrong by us.  People only started giving a shit when they realised it was a great wedge to drive between Scotland and rUK.
If Westminster tomorrow morning wakes up and decides to abolish Holyrood and the Scottish Government they can, and there's absolutely nothing anyone can do to stop them. The European Parliament, Commission and Council cannot dissolve Westminster, or the French parliament, or any other national parliament or government. Also anyone can leave the EU at any time, without asking for permission. Stop with this BS that UK == EU. It's not. Deal with it.
> The European Parliament, Commission and Council cannot dissolve Westminster, or the French parliament, or any other national parliament or government.  But that is its long term goal of the EU to devolve national parliaments, and form a superstate. It doesn't have the power currently but it will do one day.
Sorry but I'm talking about today's real world. If you wish to chat about political science fiction I'm sure there are other subs.
> Sovereignty is only ever ceded to the EU, it is never returned. The exact opposite is true for the UK over the past few decades.    This is true but we are still in vastly different ballparks in terms of what sovereignty has been ceded. No sane nation would seek pure independence, it would be an isolationist hell akin to North Korea. So it is not too difficult to understand why after leaving the overbearing 'parent/child' style relationship of the UK, Scots would seek something less constricting.
I think Scotland is generally more on point with what the EU is about than the rest of the UK. Bit of trade, bit of protection for workers and the environment. Sometimes you have to compromise for the greater good etc.   The UK has tried to diminish the protection part and increase the trade part..most recently being the force behind TTIP and fighting the working hours directive. The newspapers especially down there have been brutal towards the EU. Mainly to protect their man/woman in number 10. People get poorer, blame the EU, pay more for goods, blame the EU, not get our own way every time, blame the EU. Everything has been negative for decades.     I think Scots have a more measured look. We are not embarrassed by having an EU flag on signs for projects paid for by the EU. We'll actually mention in the newspapers that projects were. We are more aware of the good and the bad, then just the bad as publicised down south.   If you want to see what lack of powers feel like, try being a moderately left Scot under right wing Tory government voted for nearly exclusively by England. The amount of powers the EU would take is minuscule compared to that. So, we manage to get some back, but still the vast majority of taxes and expenditure is decided in London.  Comparing the EU and UK is no way and apples to apples comparrison
I have a bit of love (and hate) for both.
Aye.
Load of BS, Scotland voted the same as most remain places in Wales and England. My part of Cardiff and Cardiff in general voted remain more than most of Scotland. Its not like Scotland has a fucking 99% turnout and everyone voted to stay in the EU, loads didnt bother coming out and those that did, about 40% voted to stay in...40% isnt exactly a small figure so I dont know why Scots keep making out that they desire the EU...if 40% of any country rioted, the country would be in a state of civil war for a decade.
William Wallace was a terrorist who tried to overthrow the rightful British government.

Then kindly fuck off! Most English people I know would rather you left the 1st time! Stop bitching have your little vote and do the rest of the uk a favour and fuck off! Enjoy going bankrupt! 
Always tempted to check out someone's post history when I see a post like this.  Yours is beautiful. 
So many exclamation marks. 
Yeah, I don't get chance to do that! I have a life you know, Friends, Family a good Job/Social life. Sorry I don't live in my mums basement living of benefits wondering where my next pizzas coming from or Blaming the English for all the problems that you have!  TBH that's not even the point, I'm not gonna sit here listening to you lot slag of a country you voted not 2 years ago to stay apart off and blame everything on us. You knew this vote was coming up and you knew the chances was we was gonna leave.  The fact is the United Kingdom has done more for the Scotts then Europe ever has or ever will! In fact the United Kingdom had done more for Europe then any other European country has put together. Stop blaming us for all your problems, Pull your fucking pants up and get on with it! If not have your little Indr2 and fuck off cause we are sick of being blamed for your shit!  
Peak delusional Nigel has been reached  It's always the little Englander type that seems to get annoyed when people from Scotland think, "you know what, I think we could do a better job of running ourselves than Westminster could" . They seem to think that stating that Westminster doesn't have the best interest of Scotland at heart is somehow an attack on them.  And no, we didn't know this vote was coming up since nobody expected the Tories to get a majority.
Have you considered Zen?
> I'm not gonna sit here listening to you lot slag of a country you voted blah blah blah  So fuck off, then.

> when Scotland heads off and prospers in the EU.  That's not what small countries do in the EU.  Scotland has more capability to bully the rUK into doing what it wants than as another voice at the back of a large room that the people around the table don't care about anyway. 
> That's not what small countries do in the EU.  Aye, the poor Danes and Belgians.  Struggling, so they are.
Ehh I can't see it.  The UK will take a hit but it'll adjust in time, I'm not sure it'll be fast though because the UK seems utterly unable to do anything quickly and rebalancing an economy isn't something that can be done overnight.  UK can definitely succeed outside of the EU though and if that's what the people want then more power to them - it's not what I want and it's not what Scotland wants but I've little doubt that with enough effort and competent leadership the UK can make a go of brexit.  It's going to cause some pain in the short-medium term though I think that much is certain, it's a huge shift and will require some new political thinking which currently doesn't seem to exist.  Hopefully it does the Tories some serious damage though, their credibility has to be damaged for a long time by Brexit.

How do you know Scotland would prosper with the EU and with independence?
[deleted]
You what?
[deleted]
Because Scotland isn't necessarily going to get into the EU if independent.  What's the currency option?  All shipbuilding will be lost as the Royal Navy doesn't give complex warship contracts to foreign countries.   We have a £15 billion deficit. How will we deal with that? With whisky and shortbread?  We get a lot of funding from the wider UK government. We wouldn't have that anymore.  More of our everything goes through the UK rather than the EU.  There are hundreds of reasons why independence is idiotic.  My original jab was because you think the UK will be knackered out the EU but Scotland would be fine away from the UK.
[deleted]
*I think it's reasonable to believe we would be accepted.*  I don't think we should be going into things because "we should be okay, probably."  *Euro seems fine*  There is no guarantee we will be in the EU.  *That's not true.  There are four ships being built, as we speak, by Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering in Korea.*  Complex warships are destroyers, frigates, subs. Combat ships. Those built in Korea aren't warships. They're tankers.   https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/uk-government-admit-no-warships-if-scotland-had-voted-yes/   *There are a number of options once full fiscal control is taken on. I'm obviously not going to sit and write a Scottish Budget here and now, but to say a relatively small budget is a reason not to govern our own country seems absurd to me.*  Just give me one option. The oil industry is in tatters now and that's what the 2014 White Paper banked on - oil being $120+ a barrel.   *We would receive funding from the EU*  But no where near on the scale that we do from the UK.   *And there's no reason that this would be required to change*  Again, there is no guarantee of anything.  *How come the only ones you've dreamt up are easily solved and or factually incorrect?  If these are your best arguments, the rest must be terrible.*  None of what I've said is easily solved. Just going "it'll be fine, probably, I think" isn't solved. I take you mean "factually incorrect" in regards to the shipbuilding comment. It is in fact you that are wrong, as I have proved.    *The EU is far, far more important to Scotland than the UK.*  In many ways it isn't. I like many aspects of the EU. Let's not be silly however.      
[deleted]
*Luckily that's not what I said.  But you know, or you should know, that entry would be through negotiation.  We aren't barred.  We meet the requirements.  Give me a reason we would be denied?*  There is no guarantee we would get in.   *I was going by what you stated.  If you are now changing your statement to that of complex warships being the subject of your comment, that's fine.  But I can't read you mind, particularly when your original statement was something completely different.  Anyway, glad to hear you agree that ship building would not in fact be lost, although 'complex warships' may not be an option.  It would be nice to see Scotland building those ships rather than Korea though.*  I have changed nothing from my original statement. Complex warships are all we make for the Royal Navy. If we lose those, we lose the industry.  *Oil is one option.  OPEC has just cut production and oil is approaching $60 per barrel.  It is only going to continue to rise.  It's a finite resource against a backdrop of increasing strong demand.  But the solution would not be a magic bullet, it would be a combination; tax, services and economic initiatives.*  Oil rises and falls all the time. It will crash again like it has many times before. The problem now is that our oil industry has been absolutely decimated.   *We receive zero funding from the UK.  We are part of the UK; it's our own money.*  Barnett Formula. Subsidies.    *But that isn't an argument.  It's doom mongering at best.  Just saying no no no to everything isn't debating.  Of course trade would continue; give me a reason it would halt or admit that it is a non-point.*  You saying I'm scare-mongering? It's called being sensible. "Hope over fear" has had great effect these past few months hasn't it? Independence would go the same way as Brexit in terms of damages and could be considerably worse.  *Well no.  You stated **All shipbuilding will be lost**.  That is factually incorrect.*  Read the article I posted. We only make complex warships. The Royal Navy will not give those contracts to a foreign country.    *To you perhaps.  But not, as the vote showed, to the majority of Scots.*  I voted to Remain FWIW. If Scots weren't fond of the UK the 55% wouldn't have won in 2014.    
[deleted]
It was based on many things, one of them being that admittedly.   *I appreciate you have the best interests of the nation at heart, and I hope you understand my feeling is the same.*  Same to you. Nice talking to you.
Because the UK has the ability to adapt.  It's not a country that suffers from any real lack of ability, it has a well educated population, it has relatively good infrastructure, it has an industrial past and the ability to re-industrialise areas if it so wishes... it has a good knowledge of what will be required to make a success of being outside of the EU.  It'll be difficult, it'll be an absolute bastard for the people living there, people will very likely suffer in the short-medium term since the UK economy simply isn't designed around being out of the EU but that can be changed and will have to change.  I think there's a danger of looking at brexit and assuming nothing will change in terms of politics, economic policy etc. but it'll all have to be modified and given the people aren't likely to just settle for the country to destroy itself I think they'll drive this change.  Just as Scotland can and will adapt to being out of the UK, the UK will adapt to being out of the EU.  Everything can change. 
this adaptability you speak of, where was it when the UK was a full member of the EU? here is an organization that is not only willing to work with you but also to adapt to your needs, a good partner as any could be had. the UK majority somehow could not bear that and have decided to throw themselves at the mercy of the self interested world, yet we're supposed to believe you'll be able to adapt to an increased hostility when you couldn't even adapt to working with your cousins? i find it hard to believe this train of thought.
> it has an industrial past and the ability to re-industrialise areas if it so wishes...  Coming late to the party here, but the above comment really stands out. When successive Westminster government have assisted the destruction of British manufacturing, I'm astounded that you suggest they can simply turn industrialisation back on again like turning on a tap. Please give one example where you think this can happen?
It absolutely can.  it's a question of willing.  Governments can and do change, if the country needs to do something in order to maintain some quality of life for its people then it will do it.  I'm not suggesting for a second that it can just be turned on like a tap, if the requirement to rebalance the Uk economy becomes clear then there's going to be a hell of a lot of suffering and arguing in the short-medium term.  If needs must, if it becomes clear that an economy heavily reliant on services can no longer be relied upon then the UK will have little choice but to adapt.  I'm absolutely confident in Scotlands ability to adapt too, if we want to we can rebalance our economy and actually make things again. I refuse to believe the Tory mantra of it being impossible to have a healthy industrial economy in the west, it's very possible and just requires willing. 
Plenty of countries are successful outside of Europe.  The UK perhaps won't be *as* successful as it could have been but much like how Scotland was never going to turn into some hyperinflation hellscape in 2014 neither will the UK now.

I feel much better already. Banning cunts helps. 
There is a bit of an argument for letting these kind of comments stand: they make no difference, and in the unlikely event that they actually do make a difference it may be to turn a few noers into yessers.  Oh the sweet sweet irony.
Please... if you get a referendum... make sure this time you do it right and vote away from the UK... I am pretty sick of this whole argument.  Unfortunately I don't think this will happen for a long long time...as Nigel Farage once put (whether you agree with him or not) "its not best out of three!"
The guy that was preparing to fight on after the Brexit vote because he thought he was going to lose..and his little buddy that had already started a petition for a second referendum..which ended up with 3.5m signatures? 
He could have fought all he wanted after brexit, it wouldn't have made a difference, just because he may not  have said this if the vote was the other way round doesn't mean it is any less valid as a statement.   Also 3.5 million signatures... crazy, however still short 43 million signatures of the actual turnout on the day.   http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information   edit: a word
Of course it would have made a difference. He himself had started preparing for best of three. You think Brexiteers like Carsewell and Davies were just going to pop back in their box? Look at what happened in Scotland after the referendum. The independence movement coalesced round the SNP and absolutely killed the three split unionst parties taking 56 out of 59 seats.   Much the same may have happened down south if remain had won. Labour, Lib Dems and the Tories thinking it was over and an energised UKIP vote against them voting on a single issue. It would probably have been carnage as UKIP won seats in the south from the Tories and north from Labour.   It still may happen with a soft Brexit.  This thing is far from over
No your not getting me, I am saying that it doesn't make a difference to his statement... it will not be a "best out of three" situation, (whether his particular side won or not).   We have done the damage now, and we must plow on forward with getting the brexit right. All this complaining about woulda/shoulda/coulda is not helping anything. 
Is soft Brexit a Brexit?   The problem is nobody defined what Brexit meant beyond vague statements. So no chance am I sitting back and not fighting for the softest possible Brexit...after all Brexit is Brexit..isn't it?
Reports so far:  1: rule 4: just lock the fucking thread and let the /r/the_donald go jerk each other off at home.  2: dae le drumpf is a racist xDDDDDDDDDDDD  3: spam  4:  Don't be a cunt  5: put my report in your comment please :)
Those fucking cucks over at /r/The_Donald are triggered
I know. Away back to your safe space /r/The_Donald
This thread is fucked. I propose a total ban on non-/r/Scotland regulars, at least until we figure out just what the hell is going on.
Ach it's not so bad. We've banned a rake of cunts and the other folk are Yanks from /r/all.
The irony of this post.
Was 100% intentional, I'm certain.
I've never been so proud of our subreddit. Their brigading failed miserably.
I like that a lot of people seem to think that this has something to do with the current political situation in America.  Nope; we thought he was a complete cunt over here waaaay before he was ever a presidential candidate.
The hipsters of cunt despising
Hi! I am a Mexican citizen and I want to say thanks for the support and solidarity! More than unity with Mexico I thinks this is a statement that says we need to move forward as an international community and really just as human beings. 
Hi! I'm a Scottish citizen and I want to say Nae bother wee Juan 
United as Juan!
I'll agree to that, and I'll begin to behave that way when citizens of your nation cease entering my country through dishonest means. 
Would you fucking weescht, this is /r/scotland, we don't give two fucks about your election, we hated Trump years before this kicked off.
I am not for illegal immigration. Your comment suggests that until all dishonest means cease you are not for finding realistic solutions to this very problem and its sypmtoms. Illegal  immigration arises from a neccesity. Mexico has many political, economic and social problems. However, Mexico is growing (slowly) and migration of mexicans has actually decreased. I am not implying that other nations should "give checks" to Mexico to help solve its problems; just that we should WORK  in symbiosis. Trust me, I wish Mexico was not so dependent (economically as partners and by regulations set upon Mexico) on the US. We have a saying here "When the US gets the flu, Mexico gets pneumonia." 
Away and shite, cunto. 
Oh piss off with your bullshit politics. 
Get to fuck, this isn't the place for your cunt politics.
As an American, I love you so much, Scotland.
welp. This thread has been invaded by r/the_donald members
No it hasn't (it has).   They're not very subtle.
Welcome to /r/all. Where you cant spew bullshit without being called out. 
[deleted]
You're right. Instead lets parade around dumb idiotic shit like the rest of this thread saying that the golf course is shit despite it's consistent ranking among the best in the world. LOL DRUMPF AMIRITE
[deleted]
Okay
[deleted]
Yes because golf is only elitist racist bigots. Your country must be great then.    Also you forgot xenophobic. Throw that buzzword in too for maximum tolerance 
As you're finding out yourself no doubt. 
Where am I "being called out"? 
I'm calling you out.   Right here,  right now! 
oh shit son. see you at the [flagpole](http://www.snopes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trumpflag.jpg)
As much as I despise Trump as a person, and the tactics he employed to get this club built, I would not suggest it is "wildly unpopular" up there. The amount of people I have heard gushing about it in the press, and fawning over it after visiting the clubhouse is probably matched by golfers who reluctantly say it's a decent course. 
I live in the little village Balmedie that the course is situated and i haven't met anybody from around here that is happy about it being here. That said its obviously a good course and a lot of people that aren't from here enjoy it   EDIT: Wildly unpopular is correct in terms of the majority of natives, as most Scots don't appreciate a man bullying people into giving up their homes . And relentlessly trying to sabotage plans for a beneficial offshore wind farm, on the grounds that it will ruin the view from his massive ecosystem ruining golf course.
I'm from Ellon. I don't know anyone that's happy it got built. I don't know anyone that uses it either.
It's not for them. 
Of course it's not for them,  but is it so much to ask that the plebs give up just a little bit more so that the rich will have another bauble to play with?
Idk? I can't afford a Ferrari but there's a Ferrari dealership down the road taking up space that could be something more beneficial. It's okay for something not to be for you 
Was the  Ferrari dealership built on an SSSI with the promise of massive benefits to the local economy including thousands of jobs?
It's certainly a place of employment for many people. 
[Trump promised 6,000 jobs and only created 200.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/donald-trump-fails-to-deliver-on-golf-resort-jobs-pledge-8693854.html)
Many? Probably less than 10.
Which is more jobs than old lady florence was employing in her house that she got bought out of at %150+ of value.   and in this example, 10 is definitely more than an empty field. 
So why not build a chairlift up the north face of Ben Nevis? It will surely employ a couple of students during the summer time.  If you ruin all of your SSSI's then the tourists will stop coming.
For some reason I think more people go to the golf course than whatever it was before. 
Whatever it was before? You really know what you are arguing for.
Well it wasn't developed. 
Is that Ferrari Dealership also right next to people's homes and a site of special scientific interest?
No. But at one time I'm sure there were homes in the region that were demolished for the road expansion and businesses being built. Homes get bought and destroyed all the time for growth. 
What 'growth' was needed in this instance? Another golf course in the country that invented it, from a guy with dubious business ethics at best, that didn't even deliver anywhere near the economic boost he claimed, that embroiled our government in the courts over petty shite like their right to build clean energy solutions?  But no, please tell me more about the Ferrari dealership that is equvalent to this situation.
What do you mean what growth? Are you trying to say businesses don't expand or build to meet some demand or reach new markets? Do you understand how businesses operate? 
You asserted that 'homes get bought and destroyed all the time for growth'.  So you're saying that the SSSI was destroyed for 'growth'? What growth?
You've confused him. I think that was a few too many words for his tiny brain
Wat
Why don't you ask your countries lawmakers since they're the one's who gave the thumbs up for this to happen?
Something we have been doing. Pretty sure the current government aren't much to blame though it was back before I could even vote. 
Well a golf course isn't exactly loud or traffic-causing, on the bright side
I would love to live next to a golf course. People are really complaining about living next to it? It's a quiet sport, the place will always be kept looking nice, home prices are going to rise because living next to a golf course is nice.   Holy shit, y'all just hate it because Trump right? It's not like it's a football stadium or a strip club or something. 
I'm guessing you are American from some words you used, so have a look mate, this is r/Scotland   We already live next to enough golf courses. I for one live a couple minutes drive from five.   Other than that, educate yourself on why this particular course is unpopular before assuming a load of shite. 
Where the fuck are all these Americans coming from the day?!
From the set of a remake of  "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Zoomers, Rockets and Trumpets.   
/r/all plus the UK loves to come shit on us so we'll come over and shit on y'all too. All's fair in internet complaints.  But really, I'd love to live next to a golf course, those houses fetch a premium. 
That's exactly what we need in Aberdeen. Inflated housing costs.
>those houses fetch a premium.   House prices are bad enough in Scotland without some cunt artificially inflating them with his golf course.  Yeah, fuck knows how this made it on to /r/all.
You know if you go shit in the streets and burn buildings down it'll lower house prices, you should go do that. 
Aye I'll make sure yours is first on the list ya knob jockey.
We hit /r/all? Fuck. I thought that had been disabled? Mods, sort it out, fuck all good comes of /r/all. 
I for one think this thread is hilarious
If I knew how, I would.
Did you miss this bit of his comment?   > a site of special scientific interest  What about the legal challenges he brought against our government because he didn't want to have to look at wind farms?   Local people have plenty of reasons to be unhappy - you've clearly come over from the_donald with no knowledge of this specific case
And its not Trumps fault that you dont legislate sites of special scientific interest better.
They are legislated. 
So either Trump is running an illegal golf course or it isnt legislated as it should be and as a citizen you are at fault...
The government allowed it to be built based on Trump's promises about jobs and economic benefits. Turns out he was talking total bollocks. It's a shame our politicians were too thick to see through Trump's lies
No, I came from all. I don't post on the donald or even really care about him at all.   And I looked for a description of the SSSI and it's just a bunch of sand, and Denmark has one, and nothing says it was destroyed. And you've got like 2,999 other ones in Scotland. 
Stop trolling,  Donald.
Yes. Saying that something not for me is okay is trolling. How dare I 
Dude, all your other troll replies are right there in the open for all to see their trolliness.
What troll replies are those? The ones you disagree with? So dissenting opinions are trolls? 
It's not for the plebs 
Yep it is for the jetset white trash. 
\>Don't know anyone who uses it  Because it wasn't built for you.  It's widely regarded as one of the best destination golf courses in the world. 
Be even better when the wind farm opens. ;)
Source?
Any golf ranking website. 
Would you like to provide reference to a good, neutral one for non golf fans? Just curious 
What do you mean neutral one? http://lmgtfy.com/?q=trump+scotland+golf+course+ranking  Google has numerous lists. Pick one you don't think is "biased"
Well, my apologies for asking you a polite question. I know nothing about golf, so I don't know which publications/websites are considered serious and which ones just write tourism puff pieces. 
I think he's mad he can't afford to play it. This thread reeks of typical Reddit attitude of "can't afford it so it needs to not exist!" 
Naw it disny it reeks of 'some arrogant American businessman assumes he can do what he wants in any country'. The entitlement is breathtaking.
Welcome to life where people have money, buy things, and do what they want with their property.   Go join a commune or some shit if it bothers you so much. 
>do what they want with their property  Well no that's the point I'm making. He's not allowed to do what he wants but assumes that he can, which is why he traipsed our government through the court for having the audacity to pull him up for it.
/r/Scotland has been invaded by the tiny hands idiots.
Can they even golf with that disability?
Of course, it's the only sport where they can pick up the ball (naturally it requires both hands) and screech they're not playing any more, and it's their ball and they're going home.. so nerr!
Who are you to say what someone can or can't do? 
Who is Trump to say the government can't build a wind farm on their own land in the sea? 
He's allowed to do what he wants because money bribes people and it has since the beginning of time. Money is power and power lets you do what you want to an extent depending on how much power (money) you posses.   Being unhappy with the idea is fine, but not recognizing that the more power (money) you have the more you can get away with, is just naive. 
Just shrugging your shoulders and tolerating bribery is how places become corrupt shitholes. 
I'm not saying it's right. 
No, you're saying shut up and know your place and let the plutocrats do as they please. 
Nope just clarifying. 
Except that's a load o' pish.  Trump is a fat fucking rocket who got telt exactly where he could stick his money (right up his arse if yer wondering).  His golf course is a shitehole, Micheal Forbes still owns his farm and the windmills are getting built.  Get back in the sea, ye tiny handed fanny.
Weird you say that considering everyone who golfs say it's one of the best in the world. Hmmmm. Must suck being so mad at someone and also being so wrong. 
> the haggis man got angry angry that means I win   Being aesthetically pleasing disnae preclude one fae being a shitehole.  For example: the whole of Aberdeen.   
What the Hell are you even saying. 
You'd ken if you weren't a wide, brigading cunt.
>brigading  Lol
> Dougie Maclean shagged my maw in the 80s, so now I spend hours shitposting aboot Doland Troomp on a forum for Scots
This post is on /r/all. Get over yourself. Typical Scottish inferiority complex 
> shite! the natives are laughing at me. better start stroking my flag pole 
Wat
I think you'll find it's "fit?" nae "wat?"
Oh hey, /r/the_donald user.
Its called money also known as power. A scientific entity that has existed since the beginning of time and decides what exists and what goes extinct.
The reason it's unpopular is because a lot of locals were pushed off land they didn't want to sell to get it built.  It's a really nice golf course in a beutifal part of Scotland.  Doesn't mean it's good to come in with a team of lawyers and force people out of homes and land that in some cases have been in the family for generations to built the fucking thing.
If they could be made to sell, it wasn't their land 😂
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_purchase_order
No. I don't give a shit about golf. What I dislike is building on a SSSI. Ignoring the complaints by local people. Fucking over the people that live(d) on the site. Also the fact it's owned by Donald Fucking Trump.
Sounds like you're immature then. 
For wanting to protect our local wildlife. For defending the rights of the local population? The things most effected. Yeah sure. Not like I did a report at university on it or anything.
Uh oh watch out. We got a guy writing reports over here!
Yeah someone you studied something extremely relevant to the development and has a good understand of the topic. The next time I want an opinion pulled out of someone's ass I'll know to look for you.  TBH you seem like a troll so I'm just going to stop feeding you. Ah you're from the donald. Explains everything.
You think you're an expert because you studied something for school. Yikes. 
Well my degree would probably give me the right to call myself an expert.   Don't know why I keep falling for your bait.
Because you're an idiot. Also lol yes a degree makes you an expert. Surely your degree in golf courses in Scotland is incredibly useful. 
Unlucky. 
It wasn't built for people from around there,  it was built as an international golf destination. 
Because we have such a shortage of other golf courses in Scotland /s
I mean no, we don't, but we don't have a shortage of "indistinct pieces of field" either, so nothing much of value was lost.
It wasn't an "indistinct piece of field" is was an [SSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest). 
Which, again, in the UK we aren't exactly short of : https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Sites_of_Special_Scientific_Interest_by_Area_of_Search
I bet you voted no as well.
Voted yes.  Voting remain.  Am of the opinion that were Trumps golf course not there the locals would be apoplectic about the wind farm as well.
I highly doubt that. Its 2 miles out to sea. 
I've seen plenty of people in Scotland object to wind farms for the exact reasons Trump is objecting to this one (it ruins the view).
Yes but they're generally not far from their house on the land, correct? The ones he's greeting about are two miles away in the middle of the sea!
[Nope](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/windpower/9303940/Offshore-wind-farm-is-cut-back-by-a-third-after-public-protests.html), [People](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/14/pro-wind-protesters-offshore-windfarm) [bitch] (http://www.challengenavitus.org.uk/) [regardless](http://www.windfarmaction.com/)
>I've seen plenty of people in Scotland object to wind farms   Practically all of those you just presented are on about English proposals. Why are you being disingenuous?
Except the last one, which is a page dedicated to protesting wind farms in Scotland.  
And the only thing I can see about them talking about offshore wind is about English windfarms again, and that you should make up your own mind if you read the info.
How is this an argument? How is setting the precedent of simply buying them out a good one? What's the point of protecting anything if you can just throw enough money at it?
Maybe you should be mad at the people that sold then.   Also how do you tend to improve anything anywhere if you can't buy people's property? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_purchase_order  I was referring to SSSI's if you'd bothered to read the post.
And did you read mine? Be mad at the people responsible. Not the ones who take advantage of your idiots. 
> Be mad at the people responsible.  Donald Trump.
til bullying = paying tons of money to people to sell their land
No, **bullying**  those that don't want to sell-up,  including cutting off the water supply of an elderly lady - she had to use a local burn FFS, and a campaign of vilification and smearing of others in the press and broadcast media.   One of his victims subsequently won a "Scots Person Of The Year Award" :D
You display an astonishing ignorance about the campaign of harassment - sometimes illegal - by Trump and his contractors against locals who refused to sell their land.
I took 'wildly unpopular' to mean by the Scottish people in general. This guy is tweeting for an international audience and I took it as him getting across that a) Trump built a golf course in Scotland and b) he made people mad in the process. We might talk about how the people of that specific part of Scotland feel about it, but internationally, we're a wee place that they just lump as 'Scotland' for news and views about us. I don't think he was aiming his tweet specifically at golfers who can afford to play there, it was a wider statement. 
Then it's wrong either way.  With golfers it's wildly popular, with Scottish people in general they don't give a fuck.  "Wildly unpopular" is dishonest whatever way you shake it.
I don't think 'dishonest' is fair. It was met with protests, an award winning documentary about it was made, petitions against it were signed, and then when he started complaining about the wind farms and reneging on his promises, the protests started all over again and even our own First Minister - who had supported the building of it in the first place - ended up getting pissed off with him. Calling it wildly unpopular is totally valid.   You guys over at /r/The_Donald are really mad about this, huh? 
I'm not "you guys over at the_donald".  I am Scottish.  There are more people who love it than hate it and many more who don't give a fuck than both combined.  "Wildly unpopular" is overly strong hyperbole tailored to suit the media narrative of the moment and feed into preconceptions about Trump.
You post there, so yes you are. 
Well I've lived here a lot longer than I've posted there.  Whatever point you're trying to make is not landing as smoothly as you'd hoped.
I don't know why you keep telling me you're Scottish. I'm pointing out that people who use /r/The_Donald are getting mad about this. You use that sub, you are one of those people. It's not complicated. 
Mad about people being wrong and citing lies and bad facts? Do you hate knowledge as much as you hate trump? 
I'm not mad, so there's a complication somewhere.
You seem pretty sensitive about that sub. 
You guys are extremely sensitive about it being pointed out, which is all anyone needs to do to trigger you. Muh safe space!
Huh? 
That sub seems pretty sensitive about this post. 
If you say so. 
[deleted]
Nah, I have ignored that rag since the onslaught following the UTG debacle. I mean the golfing press - of which I am not sure how biased they would be.   Edit: of course you are right that the P&J were fawning over it. I meant I did not include them worthy of mentioning...
So it's pretty good then?
From what I've heard, it's possibly one of the finest courses in the world.   I don't know if you know much about golf, but I've heard from everyone who's played it that it's better than Royal Aberdeen, Murcar, Carnoustie, Dukes, St Andrews (Old and New) and probably on par with Kingsbarns which is a course most folk can agree is the best in Scotland.   In conclusion, Donald Trump is a buffoon, but he makes wonderful golf courses and if he wants to plough money into Scotland then so be it, lets take his money, doesn't mean we have to like him. We can still all think he's a cunt. 
You sensible fucker you. See this boys? Piss on Trump all you want but don't cut your own throat when it comes to improving the local economy. 
Where is the significant benefit to the local economy? Trump's development [destroyed a Site of Special Scientific Interest \(SSSI\)](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/teed-off-the-residents-of-foveran-links-speak-out-about-donald-trump-s-golf-project-7939044.html) and came [nowhere close](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/trump-fails-to-create-promised-jobs-and-investment-in-scotland-locals-say-a6801466.html) to delivering the economic benefit he promised. In fact, Trump has been embroiling the Scottish Government in expensive legal battles over renewable energy projects which would benefit the local economy!
So that barren field was great for the economy before? How many times did you visit that site to marvel at whatever sandy thing it was before? 
Tell me, American Trump supporter. How much has this golf course given to our economy? 
No idea. But I guarantee its more than a plot of worthless sand. 
So you would be fine with a foreigner creating a resort for the wealthy in a nature reserve which 'supposedly' makes money for the government, but which you, the person who lives there, will have no part in?   Would you also be okay with the foreigner who created the resort to fight your government and your town against the building of renewable energy sources because it might affect their income?
Youve just described "business" 
And you didn't even attempt to answer my question. 
You described what a business does in your post and then asked if I would be okay with it. That should be obvious to you. A functioning society needs 'business' to survive. 
It is not obvious to me because you did not explain your view, you just skipped past a question by asking another question, it shows that you do not comprehend what I am saying or are just too lazy to read.   What I described is not just normal business. Normal business is the delivery of goods for profit.  I have yet to see a profit from Trump. What he is doing is exploiting communities who rely on  the county representation from MSP's in Hollyrood who are failing them.   Scottish people aren't happy that Trump has done this because the people of Scotland don't want it, we do not care about an extra few million pounds towards our economy when our land is being destroyed. We don't share the same culture as you, where we are willing to sacrifice nature for a few quid.   I do not see why this is so hard to comprehend. But then again, you are a Trump supporter. 
And where do you think those businesses make goods? or provide services? Imaginary land where no one previously can claim the property?   and yes, insult me. that'll show me! oh man  also maybe you should care about a few million towards your economy. Then you would be more relevant and not an afterthought to England. 
Businesses make their goods from complying sources which abide by the rules of Capitalism to give to corporations in exchange for another type of profit towards that corporation. None of which has been given back to Scotland, and since you cannot prove that our economy is somehow better off, it is, in a Capitalistic sense, not.   >and yes, insult me. that'll show me! oh man  Let's be honest, you really deserve it. You bring nothing to a conversation except the usual idiocy which Trump supporters argue.   >also maybe you should care about a few million towards your economy. Then you would be more relevant and not an afterthought to England.   The renewable energy which your glorious leader argued against would bring many more millions in energy saving than a golf course. Scotland will always be an afterthought to England in the world stage, I agree with you there. It is, however up to the people of Scotland to live under our own circumstances and not be exploited by idiotic businessmen who wish to further their career through politics whilst giving nothing back to society. I wish the USA a lot of luck in the incoming elections, but it seems like a pish in the ocean when the only decent candidates are Sanders and Stein.  
> up to the people of Scotland to live under our own circumstances and not be exploited by idiotic businessmen who wish to further their career through politics whilst giving nothing back to society  Maybe you should be mad at the people of scotland who sold their land, or the politicians who approved whatever deals. and Maybe if that still bothers you, you should fight to close the borders of scotland down. You seem incredibly misinformed about the real world.  >None of which has been given back to Scotland  as a golf destination it's interesting how the golf course runs with no employees and visitors to the course don't spend any money.   
>Maybe you should be mad at the people of scotland who sold their land, or the politicians who approved whatever deals.  We still have a semi-feudal ownership of land and it does bother a lot of Scottish people, it is something which we are currently fighting against albeit in a small precedents. It is one of the reasons that we fought against Trump. He is buying our land against the people's will. The people who live here shouldn't suffer because our government is bad.  >and Maybe if that still bothers you, you should fight to close the borders of scotland down. You seem incredibly misinformed about the real world.  Our borders should remain open to all who seek shelter but not for those who seek to exploit.   Can you explain how I am misinformed about the real world?   >as a golf destination it's interesting how the golf course runs with no employees and visitors to the course don't spend any money.   They could spend millions every day, where do those millions go? How much tax is given to the government? How much money is given to the people who have to deal with the influx of rich people who take up the roads with their cars? There is none from what I can see.  
> The people who live here shouldn't suffer because our government is bad   So this is Trumps fault? Change your fucking government if you're unhappy with the system. Jesus man how can you rationalize this?   >how I am misinformed about the real world?  Because you want the best of both the old school peaceful no development bullshit and also the benefit of a modern and globalized world where people go to other countries  >They could spend millions every day, where do those millions go? How much tax is given to the government?  You tell me. More than a thing of sand was giving to the government.   >How much money is given to the people who have to deal with the influx of rich people who take up the roads with their cars?    lol 
>So this is Trumps fault?  He is actively exploiting a population, so yes, without a doubt.   >Change your fucking government if you're unhappy with the system  Okay, I'll change my government right now. brb  >Because you want the best of both the old school peaceful no development bullshit and also the benefit of a modern and globalized world where people go to other countries  This is actually the exact opposite of what I would like. I do not want to live in a country with no development nor do I want to live in a neo-liberal corporate state akin to the US. You really do lack reading comprehension, I thought you were just lazy.   >You tell me. More than a thing of sand was giving to the government.   Again. We do not give a fuck. I would rather go to a beach than have 0.00000001% shaved off my tax.   >lol   The response I've been waiting for. Back to your fascist sub.  
The economic impact is essentially nil. ^as ^was ^predicted  He came in, bullied elderly residents into leaving their homes, made our environment a bit shitter, and made us basically fuck all on aggregate.
It's an incredible course and everyone here wants to play it. It's the go to pick for a round now rather than Royal Aberdeen, Murcar etc.
I understand that it is held in quite high regard. My colleague, who is a Golf Course Architect, went in with low expectations and was extremely impressed with the layout and playing conditions. 
Aye, it's an exceptional course.  Still a shed though.
Played there recently.  It is an incredible course snaking through the dunes.  Take the time to go up to the tips on 14 and 18 for an awesome view.
It's great. 
> As much as I despise Trump as a person, and the tactics he employed to get this club built  This is why it's wildly unpopular.
This is an absolute bold-faced lie and I can't believe it's upvoted this much. Trumpettes are everywhere.
You must not follow golf. 
I'm in Aberdeen a lot and I don't think I've met anyone ever who would go near Trump's golf course. I think it's clearly widely unpopular. 
But how many enthusiastic golfers do you know?
I'm surrounded by them at work and they mostly hate it.
Absolute bollocks. It's the best course in the area.
They hate it because Trump is a mong not because it's a bad course. This idea that you absolutely must separate intrinsic worth from political statements is insane, and the fact that so many people in this post can't understand that is not encouraging.
I'm in Aberdeen at the moment, and from a straw poll in our shared offices, 71% of them would. By your own reasoning, you are wrong.  
Sounds like something someone from the_Donald would say.
There are a bunch of people from that sub in here just now. It's pretty easy to spot them. One of them replied to you.
As I stated in the top post:  >As much as I despise Trump as a person, and the tactics he employed to get this club built, I would not suggest it is "wildly unpopular" up there. The amount of people I have heard gushing about it in the press, and fawning over it after visiting the clubhouse is probably matched by golfers who reluctantly say it's a decent course.  Please read carefully, before suggesting what view I hold. 
I like how people use this like an insult. Amusing. 
How many people are in your office that you can get a figure like 71% from a straw poll? :o
Seven? And five stated they would  >go near Trump's golf course.   Five out of Seven is 71%.
Just say 5/7 then you bellwhiff. 
Cute. Do you feel hard? Because you sure do sound hard. 
But on a slightly less flippant note, using percentages for such small numbers is daft. 
100% of the (4 people) people at this table disagree with you. 
That's fine, 100% of people posting this comment disagree with them.   
(the insult was in jest try not to overreact)
Clearly. You said so! 
I'm in Aberdeen now and we went for Father's Day. It's amazing 
I've heard a lot of good things about it myself. Who owns it is irrelevant tbh 
I don't get why people don't accept that trump likes LEGAL Mexicans, he literally employs hundreds of them. 
He has a strange way of showing it when describing them as rapists and [making personal attacks on members of the judiciary for being Mexican](http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/donald-trump-facing-backlash-over-mexican-judge-comments-1-4158547).
There you go with your facts, and peer reviewed articles. The_Donald only likes it when you hold their hand and tell them how great their daddy is. 
"Peer reviewed article"
That ta gave me a laugh 
This is sarcasm right? The first part was partaining to illegals, it is literally in the rest of the quote he simply forgot to add. His source is exluding the fact the judge is part of a group called of la raza lawyers and has a direct link to the la raza on their site, which has a video from 10 years ago calling for the removal or all honkeys aka whites from the southwest. As well as the fact that weeks before this the same group had a police chief on their payroll that told San Diego police to stand down at his infamous rally which had multiple arrests for battery a few days after police watched it all happen.
"Judge Curiel is an American hero who stood up to the Mexican cartels. I was proud to appoint him when I was Gov." - Arnold Swarzennegger   Yes, I'm sure that pinko commie Arnold appointed a judge who hates white people. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that Drumpf knows that he is going to lose his Trump U case and is doing damage control for that.   [From the National Review, another left wing rag](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436310/judge-gonzalo-curiel-record-reveals-little-back-trump-attack)  >While some argue that the group’s very name expresses a radical racial-identity politics, the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association contends that translating “La Raza” as “the race’” is a mistake: “While it is true that one meaning of ‘raza’ in Spanish is indeed ‘race,’ in Spanish, as in English and any other language, words can and do have multiple meanings,” says an explanation posted on their website. “As noted in several online dictionaries, ‘La Raza’ means ‘the people’ or ‘the community.’” 
He may be an American hero, but the American statute for a judge recusing himself includes the term "appearance of bias."  The above is an example.  The judge is also a member of a lawyers association that called for the public boycotting of Trump properties last summer.  He gives scholarships to illegal immigrants.  His parents were illegal immigrants who were given amnesty in the 1960's  We found out last week that he is friends with the head of the law firm that brought the class action lawsuit.  Combined, I think it is clear that it meets the "appearance of bias."
The rapist thing *was* referring to illegal immigrants and "personal attack for being Mexican" is a horrible distortion of someone suggesting the possibility of a bias existing in another.
So the illegal immigrant quote that called majority rapists is now beind touted as a sourceless argument against legal immigrants?  This is literally 99% of the reason im voting for him. Im really pretty done with the liberals right now.  Why am I saying this in the scotland sub. Furthermore, why are any of you talking about this?
> So the illegal immigrant quote that called majority rapists quote is now beind touted as a sourceless argument against legal immigrants?  You can't even form a coherent sentence you absolute dribbler
Much like Donald, http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-uses-language-typical-of-children-under-11-a6936256.html
Because they want to feel important. 
There's more info in your comment than you meant to give.
If you think anyone in the US (including trump) actually thinks ALL Mexicans are RAPIST....you're the fool.
Some, I assume, are good people. I've never met them though. And there's no question that the vast majority are rapists and thieves right? That's why you need the wall.
I have lots of friends in the oil field who work on rigs in Mexico. They tell me it's no big deal to see dead body's on side the road, or the gangs who block roads so they can steal what you have and kill you. Not all of them are like this but yeah, it's not a such a great place as you would see on mtv.
I'm not saying Mexico is a paradise on earth, I'm saying it's unfair to label the majority of them as bad people.
Because in today's PC world saying anything negative, that might involve a minority in some way, is blasphemy. How dare he not succumb to white guilt! All minorities are perfect and straight white men are the real problem, especially rich ones.
> paragraph of american pish  Square go, right now.
St Andrews was probably unpopular when it got built too.  Kinda hard to guess long term effects on something like that.
St Andrews is a beautiful town though.   Golf's expensive as fuck though.
Everything is unpopular when it's built. People don't like change or any inconvenience. But they sure do love the benefit of it 
I hate that about politics so much. Trump wears a hat. Liberals say the hat is atrociously ugly, crass, and statement against minorities. Hillary wears the same hat and liberals say is beautiful and bold hat. Conservatives do the same thing in reverse.  There is no fucking need to politicize everything and straight up lie to fit your politically narrative. Its disgustingly totalitarian to want every fiber of existence to conform to your narrow viewpoint and throw a fit when someone says Trump steaks are actually pretty tasty. Have some loyalty to the truth dammit. Talk shit about Trump's political opinions. No need to lie about everything associated with the man.
>  Liberals say ...  Spot the Septic 
>Talk shit about Trump's political opinions. No need to lie about everything associated with the man.  This is about his antics in Scotland, nothing to do with his politics. Why would we talk about his politics?   Also your American definitions of 'Liberal' and 'Conservative' are both 'right-wing' here...

He has 1 post in /r/the_donald in the past like 25 days lol.  
Aye and it's completely unreasonable to assume that they *might* also have an alt that posts there regularly? Away ye go ya rocket.
Up cote for confusing the shite outta the septics.
Maybe you have an alt that posts there too. 
You should be so lucky. 
Why would someone have an alt specifically just for posting on one subreddit? :s
Cunts dae that all the time, mostly porn subreddits but ye never know.
Here, use http://www.redditinvestigator.com/ if you're going to creep my post history.  I've made 3 comments in Sandersforpresident and 2 in The_Donald. **Obviously** I'm a Sanders supporter /s  In hindsight, that site isn't that accurate. It thinks I'm from India.
> if you're going to creep my post history  Are you from the past? We have auto-taggers now. 
Well that's where all you white supremacist dipshits went after they closed your other subs right? We're just assuming. 
I don't even go on the_donald anymore, it's pure shit. :s  And why do you think I'm a white supremacist; my name? Well now you're stereotyping me. Guess you're just like me then.
Your name and the fact that you have no sense of humor. And the fact that you are trolling for Drumpf. Pretty safe bet. You do know that all humans are merely a species of ape which descends from africa, right? And that the entire concept of "race" with regard to humans has absolutely no scientific basis? Have a great day.
> Your name and the fact that you have no sense of humor.  What are you basing this off of? There is nothing at all to go off. :s  >And the fact that you are trolling for Drumpf. >Drumpf, yeah you just proved you have 0 sense of humor if you think that's funny  >You do know that all humans are merely a species of ape which descends from africa, right?  >You do know that all humans are merely a species of ape which descends from africa, right?  And every species is based off fucking flecks of shit in space; it's irrelevant. You can clearly see physical differences between races. Color of the skin isn't the only thing.  >And that the entire concept of "race" with regard to humans has absolutely no scientific basis?  Except it does. :s  As I said above there's clear differences between races in terms of physical characteristics. Go google "black woman" and try and tell me you wouldn't be able to tell they're black even if their color was changed; you can't. If you do then you need to get your eyes checked.  
Ah there we go. The facts are stacked against you, yet you still cling to your victorian era race narrative. It's so much fun to see your worldview imploding.   I don't the ink Drumpf is funny at all, it's just that it's his real name, not his stage/ wrestling/ reality tv name.  
It's never been his real name. That's like saying we have no names because our ancestors changed them to something else, rather than not having a name. It's a stupid argument.  What facts? You didn't bring up a single argument that I didn't refute in a decent way. Besides saying you have no sense of humor for the drumpf thing. Did you even bother to do what I said? I highly doubt you did. Too scared of your race narrative to implode lmao.  Being different isn't necessarily a bad thing. You have to accept that races are indeed different, otherwise they wouldn't be classed as fucking races. They would all be one race.
Definition of Race:  >A group of people identified as distinct from other groups because of supposed physical or genetic traits shared by the group. **Most biologists and anthropologists do not recognize race as a biologically valid classification, in part because there is more genetic variation within groups than between them.**  Bold is my own distinction.
So cute, you refuse to respond to what I told you to do. Keep clinging to that "everyone looks the same" narrative. 
> Keep clinging to that "everyone looks the same" narrative  Everyone doesn't look the same, I never said they did. Go back and re-read my post because I am guessing  even with the bold outline it didn't sink into your skull. "there is more genetic variation within groups than between them" means that they are so completely different that race cannot be classified.   Engage brain before you engage your fingers next time.
>The facts are stacked against you, yet you still cling to your victorian era race narrative.  You admitting it's related to race. It doesn't matter what they're classified as. Blacks and whites are still physically different. No fucking clue what you're trying to get at.  Even if it's not officially classified as race, that is what everyone refers to it as. It doesn't matter the official classification is, definitions change constantly to fit the public narrative.   What are you even trying to argue? That blacks and whites are the same? That different colors of skin can't be classified as race? Who cares? That's what almost everyone refers to it as.  You're not even making any coherent points on what you're arguing for. Please explain it to me. After all, I'm an idiot from the_donald who doesn't have a brain, right?
Wasn't me actually.  Again, go back and actually read the replies, that was an entirely different person.
O oops, 2 many people trying to argue in other posts. Didn't bother looking at names.   So again, what are you trying to argue about? That race isn't the correct definition? Alright, race isn't the correct definition. However it's the definition most commonly used so I'm using it. Is that all you wanted to argue about, or are you gonna say my other points were incorrect?

This thread looks like my toilet pan at 11am on a Sunday morning after a heavy, heavy saturday night.
I really don't care that much about Trump in terms of Yankee politics, if ever a country deserved the choices it will have to make in November it's them but the utter obnoxious scumbag cunts who support him deserve to see him destroyed at the election.   His behaviour in trying to play billy fucking big baws in Scotland was despicable , it's to the SNP's eternal shame that they gave him anymore than the steam of their piss although at least they eventually dealt with the stubhanded cunt
BUILD HADRIAN'S WALL TEN FEET HIGHER!  MAKE ENGLAND PAY FOR IT! 
See,  when you put it like that...  Doesn't sound so bigoted 
This is why we need a wall on our southern border. They're making their way up to Scotland.
ITT: neck beards a plenty
lol it's one of the most coveted courses in a country renowned for its golf 
I think he means unpopular with the population of Scotland.
Doesn't make it right. He built over a SSSI. He built a wall around someone house and charged them for it. That's probably where he got the idea for the Mexican border.
Or it could be the wall/fence that's already there, that does a piss-poor job of keeping people out. So really he should be saying "improve" the wall on the border, not build one. 
You can't keep people out in Scotland anyway. You've no idea what you're talking about.
[I believe I found a new technology that might put the efficacy of having  a wall in doubt.](http://m.wikihow.com/Climb-a-Ladder-Safely)
Is it easier to cross a desert with or without a ladder? 
Yeah, you're right. No one will bother carrying a ladder through the never-ending Scottish deserts

Ah the flag of freedom and human rights.

If they love mexico so much why don't they go there? 
They probably do. Mexico is one of the most visited countries on Earth. We have a butt-load of foreigners who live calm, inexpensive lives here.   
Probably because all of their family, friends and life is here and they don't speak Spanish. I don't think a person is being hypocritical if they do this but don't move to Mexico...
No. The rules are if you show a flag of ANY other nation you MUST live there.   Doesn't matter if its solidarity or a joke, you've got to go there.  I made that mistake once and got sent back in time to the 1930's Spanish Republic. 
I'm actually coming to you live from the Gaza strip. That's what I get for solidarity with Palestine!

Jon Snow? is that you?
While I agree with you that owning and brandishing a Mexican flag while in America should not be met with hostility. I want to point out the thousands of signs that say "make America Mexico", so it's not like the meaning is being pulled from nowhere. 
And a Mexican flag in Scotland used a symbol of defiance against an absolute fud has a different context.   Rock on up to Balmedie and ask the locals what they think of Cheeto Jesus.
They don't. They just want Trump to know we think he's a big stinking cunt with bad hair.
We do, gotta get that Vitamin D somehow.
I know right. Let them go to Mexico and see how long they last with all the (peace) over there. (There's not much)
Mexico is home to the largest American community outside the US. The town of Ajijic, pop. 15,000, has 5,000 foreigners mostly from the US and Canada.
5000? Wow
Yup. Sounds like a little, but when you consider it's a third of the town's population, it becomes more impressive. 
That isn't true.  Puerto Vallarta is where tons of 60yo Americans buy retirement property.  There's also the artist colony San Miguel. 
Ah two cities in the whole country...
They're about the size of Edinburgh together.
Oh, fuck off, my family has owned property in Mexico for generations, and we spend all our free time down there enjoying flawless beaches and delicious margaritas. Stop believing everything you see on the news. 
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha why not live there then? Is it JUST a vacation destination for you and your family?
> why not live there then?  I don't know about OP but my job is locked to the UK, I am not moving into financial insecurity by just up and quitting. That said, I would love to go to Mexico.  The whole "why not live there?" argument is dumb as fuck, there are many reasons someone wouldn't move country that have nothing to do with how much you like the place/people.  Sorry, I forgot, logic and reasoning don't factor in here, do they?

I'd be surprised if Scottish people knew where Scotland was on a map.
This from an American, where 90% of people haven't even left their own country 
Hey, it was the 95% white Scotland that suddenly tried to teach an American presidential candidate a lesson on diversity.    But sure, we'll say that traveling 45 minutes south into England qualifies you as being both worldly and well-traveled.

*who've spent the past few centuries being both irrelevant and somebody else's bitch*  I love how you're proving the ignorant American stereotype to be nothing but the truth. 
Can Trump even play golf? Are his hands big enough to hold a golf club? 
I'll remind you this is the height of your patter power:  > Aye cos Americans are tremendous at geography lol  ya fud
That lol is a link to numerous Americans displaying their shite geography. Its not top shelf patter but it's better than the gash they're slebbering. 
Naw, it's no.
If ye say so son. 
Excellent. :)
Why are all these attempts at provocation so incredibly politically tone deaf? The image of a Mexican flag is not going to upset Trump or any of his followers. They don't have a problem with Mexico.
Except for Don's hissy fit when the PGA moved from his course to one in Mexico City... 
...from America. Trump isn't a fan of jobs leaving America, wherever they go.

If you want to be successful in business you have to take advantage of the terrible trade deals America makes. If there were tariffs or a tax on products being imported, less businesses would do this. Granted the effects of such a tax would have on the economy probably wouldn't be pleasant initially.
> If you want to be successful in business you have to take advantage of the terrible trade deals America makes.  Not true. I know dozens of very successful businesses who didn't have anything to do with terrible American trade deals.  > If there were tariffs or a tax on products being imported, less businesses would do this. Granted the effects of such a tax would have on the economy probably wouldn't be pleasant initially.  Are you saying you don't think there are import taxes in the US?  Actually, what are you on about? 
I was referring to trump suits, as should be obvious by the context of my original post.   While it's true you can be successful by making your product in America, the profits are higher if you don't. If there wasn't a cost advantage to making suits in countries outside of the US and importing them back in, people wouldn't be doing it. I personally don't think trump needs to make him self a martyr and lose out on those profits to make a political point.  A way to combat this, as trump has said, is to set taxes/tariffs on imported goods to offset the increased profit.
The Trumpkins in this thread seem pretty upset
I don't think the person who put the flag up thought Donald Trump would see it what with it being a joke and all. 
We need to get some Mexican cones there too. :)
Mexican cones?
Yeah, traffic cones to put on stuff. Except in Mexican flag colours.
Ah, gotcha.  I couldn't figure out wtf you were talking about.  But, yes, cones on all the things.
I'd pay into a crowd funding campaign to make that flagpole taller and the flag much larger. 
Trump already tried to build a wall (of sand)
Why bother?  Those dunes are massive.

BUILD A WALL AROUND IT
I wouldn't expect liberals to understand the difference between legal and illegal immigration. For some reason, they all think "Trump hates Mexico. I know what I'll do, I'll fly some Mexican flags! That'll show him!" Same with the protesters. Trump is against illegal, illegal, illegal, illegal, illegal, illegal immigration - not Mexicans. It just so happens that an overwhelming majority of America's illegal immigrants are from Mexico. 
And that Muslim immigrant who has lived in the south of England all his life and has gone through all the proper channels move to the US? If it's all about illegal immigration and not biased against certain groups, why does trump say that guy is banned? 
America restricts immigration as it sees fit. During World War Two, immigration from German wasnt allowed. Currently America is at war with a group of Muslim extremists which have a lot of influence and support. The easiest way to deal with it is to restrict immigration.
You really don't want to bring up American immigration history if you're trying to distance yourselves from racism. America has a spotted history with denying immigration rights to different races and creeds and each of these instances today they are considered mistakes.   Who exactly are we at war with then that justifies denying Muslim immigrants? A European Muslim and a middle eastern islamic terrorist have no certain similarities besides their religion. Are we then at war with Islam? Would we not then also be declaring war on our own citizens? Beyond the ethics as to why this is a bad decision, by what means will you determine an immigrant's beliefs? Ask him? If I were a terrorist I'd just as easily say Hindu and enter into the country while the moderate Muslim with nothing to hide would seek to be honest with the immigration officials and would tell the truth and then denied entry. The purpose of this isn't to stop extremists in America, only to stop brown skinned people from immigrating.

Come on /u/alanaction, if you hate misinformation so much why aren't you campaigning against one of the main offenders?
[Everyone knows that esteemed contributors to /r/the_donald are never wrong](http://i.imgur.com/c4uiQaH.png)
You left out the part where he called Mexican immigrants rapists, and where he called a judge "unfit" because his last name was Spanish. And the part about how nearly all white supremacist groups have endorsed him. Maybe that's part of the reason why the Scots hate him. Or maybe it's because he swindled them out of some good land to build his shitty golf course.   Poor Don. Maybe after another 30 years of constantly being on TV he'll finally get a fair shake with the media. It must be tough being a reality TV "businessman." No respect. 
Do you know the rape statistics on illegal immigrants crossing the border? Most the girls get raped by the coyotes.   PC culture says he's not allowed to mention that but the American people are sick to their stomachs of PC culture.  The judge has ties to La Raza and Trump is worried that the "muh racism" narrative that you and the media spew might affect him giving a fair judgement.  Not sure why Scots would hate him... Y'all should've left Britain when you had the chance.
> Not sure why Scots would hate him...  Because he's so far to the right that he's a joke here. [Even our most right-wing politicians think he goes too far](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-says-donald-trumps-policy-of-banning-muslim-immigration-to-the-us-is-a-political-a6765431.html).
Things have changed since William Wallace huh? He wasn't for open borders and English illegal immigrants
> since William Wallace  You mean over 700 years ago? Yeah, been a few changes since then mate.   Bet you've only heard of him through Braveheart, am I right? 
Yes and I got a picture with him in Edinburgh actually
Lol, you really have no idea about Scottish history do you?
Who honeslty cares what Scotland thinks of our politicians. I mean it's flattering, really- but Scotland is an irrelevant country that's like the size of Rhode Island and is a country with a population less than most US cities. No one cares.  
> No one cares.  Yeah, you care so little that you've come over and left your shitey comment for us to read
It was on r/all
Only New York has a bigger population than Scotland... You ignorant shite bag. You probably couldn't find Scotland on a map... Or New York!
Do you have any Idea how many people wouldn't be able to find Scotland on a map? Newsflash: It's a fuck ton.   Whatever. The US has 320 million people and Scotland has 5. No one cares what you think of our politicians.   
Anyone with a minimal amount of education could the fact that you can't speaks volumes!  Your are an idiot!
We haven't and wouldn't have even if we voted independence, left Britain ya dobber. We're literally joined on to it.
I love how you guys keep moving the goalposts every time he says something awful so that it seems slightly less awful. He said "they're sending us their rapists." Which is a classic racist talking point for anyone trying to scare a population about immigrants. He wasn't talking about immigrants and coyotes. The American people are sick to their stomachs of reality TV stars acting like spoiled, entitled children, who throw temper tantrums whenever somebody calls them on their lies. That's why Drumpf is plummeting in the polls. The joke isn't funny anymore. He's attempting to assassinate the judge's character because he knows that the Trump University case is going to be bad for him, because he's a snake oil salesman and that's how they operate. The Scots hate him because he's an arrogant, foolish man who cheated them out of their land. 
"drumpf" lol thanks for saving me the time of reading any of what you wrote
Sorry I should have used his stage name instead. 
His... Given... Birth... Stage name... That he was born with. Uh
this is the full quote   >“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”  He assumes some are good people. So you saying "sending us their rapists" is not including the full statement. Not all Mexicans are rapists to him. Also illegal immigration is definitely a problem here, we definitely need some form of immigration reform. Is a wall a good idea? You're asking the wrong person.   The US has not had back-to-back-voted-in Democratic presidents since JFK and LBJ. And just like the other side of the coin has said, "polls before the general mean nothing," it can apply here as well for you saying that Mr. Trump is polling badly. Republican voter numbers are up, the Republicans want a Republican in the White House. I'd say the race this year will be very, very close.   We have no idea of knowing until it happens. So, you may be mad for a lot longer than a few months depending on who votes what in November. I'm also not intending to lean you one way or the other, I'm just trying to give you some semblance of reality of what could happen.

By setting the precedent that Scots have the right to self determination, that in and of itself assures that Scotland is free.  My hope is the strength of the Yes vote will make a better Britain for everyone.  A true federation rather than the top down governance from Westminster.
As I understand it, Alex Salmond has resigned as First Minister and is heading west to Quebec. 
Lol.  The PQ could use him.  They're a completely shitshow right now.  Salmond I can respect.  [Lévesque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_L%C3%A9vesque) is someone I respect too.  Lately though the PQ spiraled into a really scary form of ethnic nationalism that has bordered on racism at times, and I know the SNP themselves have made a conscious choice to try and avoid that.  His advice would probably do a lot of good.
His timing with his resignation is excellent, what we might call a "good" resignation; one which generally sees you back in a decent political position within 12 months. Unfortunately I don't really see where he's going to go. He has built his entire career for this moment and really is seen as a one trick politician because he is so firmly associated with independence. Maybe he would find a home in PQ and then after that referendum; onto California secession!
Another Quebec referendum is unlikely for a while.  They floated the possibility of maybe another referendum in the last election and saw their vote drop to the worst it's been since 1968.  Their national wing (the BQ) has had most of its MPs quit the party in the last few months.  Even people who want independence don't want another referendum in the foreseeable future.  Edit: Just to add to that, Quebec's current Premier says he'd like to negotiate Quebec's signature on our constitution (they're the only province not to sign on).  His seat voted 65% to leave Canada back in 1995.  That's how far the PQ has fallen.
I'm guessing the concerns for the independence movement have parallels with Scotland. The x on the paper is easy, but the considerations and repercussions regarding, for example, NAFTA and NATO are uncertainties to beat the electorate over the head with. 
Currency was another big one.  From a purely financial standpoint, the federation is pretty clearly in Quebec's interests.  But keep in mind there was also a very long and sweeping process of modifying the terms of our federation to be more flexible and mindful of the interests of Quebec (and others).  Official bilingualism, recognition of the Quebecois nation, devolving some powers over immigration... all these were important.  And Quebec as a province has MUCH more power than the Scottish Parliament does.
> Currency was another big one. From a purely financial standpoint, the federation is pretty clearly in Quebec's interests.  Same bullshit being peddled as during the Scottish campaign.
Pretty much.  I was surprised Salmond wasn't more prepared on this in the first debate.  Would the UK be obligated to enter in to a currency union with Scotland? No, it would not. You're welcome to push for that, but you need a plan B.  Salmond had a reasonable answer in the second debate, but given that the PQ in Canada kept tripping over this, and I know Salmond follows Quebec politics closely, he should have seen it coming.
> Would the UK be obligated to enter in to a currency union with Scotland? No, it would not  No but it has an interest in not crashing the pound so some form of union would have emerged.
Perhaps.  Look at the Eurozone.  I know for my own sake in Canada, I wouldn't want a currency union with Quebec.   I don't think a fiscal union without a political union is a good idea.  Also crashing your currency isn't so bad if you want to help exports. :3  Salmond's suggestion of pegging to the pound was a good answer.  Lead with that.
> I know for my own sake in Canada, I wouldn't want a currency union with Quebec.  Quebec has roughly a quarter of the money, there is not much of a choice for Canada to come to some form of temporary agreement.  > Also crashing your currency isn't so bad if you want to help exports. :3  Which is a problem Quebec wants to fix with independence. Alberta is a cause of Dutch Disease in Canada which hinder the exports of non-oil drilling provinces.
Most of us don't buy the Dutch Disease stuff FYI.  Quebec's share of the economy is around a fifth actually.  But that's not the issue.  Obviously Canadian currency in Quebec would not suddenly stop having value.  What would happen is that Quebec would not have access to the Bank of Canada as a lender of last resort for it or its banks.  Nor would Scotland with respect to the UK.  Is that that unreasonable?
The other injury is that Mel Gibson is [not perceived especially well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson#Alcohol_abuse_and_legal_issues), although maybe that's just an American perception.
Please.  It's not like we voted to be oppressed by a foreign country
Wow. Some people really have had a sense of humour bypass...       I voted Yes. Obviously I'm disappointed but I'm doing my damnedest to take it with good humour and look to the positives that have come out of the process and looked to how, given the people have made their position clear, we work together to build a better nation.      For example, I'm not going to allow people to forget that it would appear that those who come from areas of severe multiple deprivation look, at least on first impressions, to have rejected the entire British state which has for far too long treated them with disdain and contempt and left them disenfranchised and disengaged.       As one woman put it "Currency? Nae money in any currency is still nae money." and talk of economic Armageddon quite understandably fell on deaf ears for those who just need to look around them and see that it would be pretty damn difficult for things to get worse.      It's being suggested that it was Gordon Brown's intervention at the end of the campaign which may have "saved the Union". Those who hold to that view would do well to remember that he didn't do it by advocating more economic neo-liberalism and corporate capitalism, nor did he advocate compassionate conservatism - he did it by utilising the rhetoric of revolutionary socialism.     Sometimes though, you've got to try and look on the bright side of life even when it is a piece of shit.
Truthfully I think folks need to have this sort of outlook more often.  This is how democracy works, and I feel that folks should really try to work with what they've been given more so than bicker about what isn't. Sure, Scotland didn't become independent, but now there's a lot more groundwork for Scotland to get greater autonomy. Either way, Scotland won in some respect, regardless of whether or not it was a simple yes or no on the poll.
You're right, it's not.
As long as you guys keep Doctor Who actors flowing, we're good.

dude what I see you every where. Are you from Scotland? I thought in a relatively small sub like this I would be free from you. 
Not A Nation Among Nations.    Did not have enough courage.    Does not want to be Scottish sort of country.    Is too much English to care at this point.    Sees no unique path for itself.   England is so big compared to others  that Scotland is always de facto part of England in the Union.  The vote was no to different politics and different goals. Keeping the symbols is just pretending. 
Scotland is already free. 
Having visited Scotland this summer, it's actually quite expensive.
No one said freedom was cheap!
Freedom costs a buck-o-five.
And if you don't put in your buck-o-five who will???

AHAHAHAHAHA. Contrary to both side's beliefs, nobody is a ball and chain. We take care of each other and we ALL benefit from the union.
Sure thing buddy.
Free, but not independent.   Like a kid who moved to an apartment where his parents pay for his car, utilities, etc. 
I agree with this.
Wrong.  
How so? Scotland just exercised its collective free will to continue as a constituent partner of the union. Scotland is not ruled by another nation, it's a willing participants in that nation.
Scotland exercised its collective free will to continue allowing the dominant power in the Union to govern and control their finances, defense, and foreign policy. Willingly subjecting to external rule (however partial or limited) is still subjecting to external rule.  Saying "we're free" would make sense if there was a constitutional mechanism guaranteeing partners in the Union the power to unilaterally decide to leave UK whenever they may wish to do so, without having to obtain central government's permission first.
Scotland is not subjecting to external rule. If anything this whole campaign shows that Scotland is an active participant in rule and one who is able to wield influence, even if we haven't quite gotten the amount of influence quite right yet. There is a clear difference in being a subject to external rule and being an active participant in the rule of a nation which includes Scotland (and therefore is not external). Scotland as a collective unit has clearly given it's consent to the latter, that collective unit was free to leave and as far as anyone can see still is at any time it can demonstrate the popular will to do so.
Nobody disputes that Scotland can influence how UK is governed, but the argument being made is that a "free" country isn't the one that is able to merely *influence* how it's being governed. It is one that holds the *absolute* power to govern itself.   There are no guarantees or enforceable agreements stating that Scotland is free to unilaterally leave at any time it demonstrates popular will to do so, and free to organize legally binding referendums whenever the Scottish parliament chooses to do so. Until there is such a thing, freedom to choose is a privilege Westminster may or may not decide to grant to any future generations, on top of that they may impose any number of arbitrary conditions they see fit.   Ultimately, the kind of freedom Scotland has is not even remotely comparable to freedom held by sovereign nations of the world. If the people of Scotland feel such an arrangement is good for them, that's wonderful. But don't call it something that it isn't. 
You can't see the wood for the trees here. England is not a sovereign nation either, nor is Wales or Northern Ireland. We all govern together and control the sovereign nation of the UK.Quick note, member states of the USA or the Russian federation aren't allowed to leave. Or vote on leaving. We just had a situation where a member of a sovereign union could vote on leaving and being instantly recognised as an independent nation by the remaining members. That more direct freedom that many could dream of.What democratic freedom do you think you don't have?
But you could apply that logic to *any* subdivision of *any* state. California isn't free because it's a part of America, so it should go independent. The San Francisco Bay isn't free because it's a part of California, so it should go independent. Oakland isn't free because it's a part of the Bay, so it should go independent. Where does this terminate?
[deleted]
And if California calls itself a country is it not? If the Bay calls itself a country is it not? What of San Jose?
[deleted]
How many people do I need to get together to form a country?
So all the talk of a referendum for Orkney and Shetland in the event of a yes vote, despite being slightly tounge in cheek, you would have supported that and their right to take their oil back to the UK?
Very well said. A quasi-freedomish state that is still controlled externally isn't free.
You just had a local election to make the decision on independence that is pretty much the same thing as a "constitutional mechanism".   What is crazy to me is that you only needed simple majority to get Independence I think you should need at least 2/3 to get something that extreme done.   If you guys want independence you should probably work on getting personally independent from the government.  If you are dependent on the government for your basic needs it shouldn't matter if the subsidies come from Edinburgh or London.
45% are unwilling and ready to leave that nation.
They're more than welcome to, but they need to accept that Scotland will not be going with them. That's how democracy works, when a group has to make a collective decision, those in the majority get their way. At the end of the day, in a straight vote, the person I cast my vote for is never elected as MP. That doesn't mean there should be some sort of timeshare on the seat to appease my views, as they are clearly not the popular viewpoint. I just don't accept that there can be an argument whereby no means yes.
Democracy means potentially disenfranchising 49% of the people.     We can eat at McDonald's drive-thru forever!  Hurrah!
As opposed to disenfranchising 51%?
"...democ­racy is the worst form of Gov­ern­ment except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time..."
It's better than definitely disenfranchising 55% of the people so that the views of 45% of the people could be honoured.
...if the Yes camp had won it would've been the exact same situation for the No voters. This is why 50%+1 is a terrible method for voting. Either way, Scotland has a tear down the middle of it, and that is a crying shame.
Not really - 45% of those who voted, who were 85% of those who registered, who were 92% of those who were entitled to register.  So only 35% of the adult population who were entitled to vote cast a vote in favour of leaving the union.
Barely, we are fettered to a corpse.
Glasgow isn't that bad!
We just held a democratic vote with 84 percent turnout and people still think we don't live in a free country.  Turn on the news and have a look at how some of your fellow sons of the earth have to live and you will maybe gain some perspective on the meaning of oppression, poverty and injustice.
Huh? The post is just taking the piss. People are very vocal about an indepenedent scotland then the reality is that most scots would rather remain in the union.
And that does not equal a lack of freedom is all I'm saying. 
Jokes aside, thank you Scotland for giving the rest of us in the UK hope.
Scotland is now the forever-adolescent adult who refuses to move out of their parents' house. Do you have basements in Scotland?
Why do the Scots like lying? They are scared the truth would set them free.  Why do Scots love ants? They also like to live in a colony.  Why don't Scots like punk rock groups? They put their music on independent labels.  What is the most unpopular dance in Scotland? The indepen-dance.  How are Scots similar to bicycles? They both need chains around them.  Why have Scots stopped wearing rings? Because freedom rings.
Fuck the down voters, these are funny. We have to accept a bit of self deprecation after all this.
What is the similarity between a table with two legs and Scotland? Both cannot stand on their own.
Im pretty embarrassed to be Scottish at the moment. Glasgow voted yes though, so at least I've got that ...
Good job Scotland you made Mel Gibson cry..  and you voted Tories.
Since when was a vote for the Union a vote for conservatives? If you hate the Tories so much just don't get people not to vote for them in the general election.
It's great, right and proper to have that right.  Is there anything we could do to help the Catalans have that right recognised as well?
Can't ya'll just get it on the ballot again in a few months and try again?  Or do you only have this one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!
Unless WM fucks up royally and the Scots get so fed up there's literal riots on the streets, no. This was their once-in-a-generation chance and the majority rejected it.
Based on what's going on here in Canada, you may get another shot at it in 20-30 years, but after that bringing it up over and over will start pissing people off.
The under 55 crowd voted majority for independence. It's the older lot that cared more about the pennies in their pension that fucked us. 
Source?
The over 55s were actually also the most heavily subjected to and susceptible to propaganda.  Don't have the internet? Can only rely on BBC "news" and venal newspapers?  Gordon Brown lying that your pension isn't guaranteed?  *Well then you're completely fucked.*  Welcome back to the UK - a "democracy" a bit like Putin's Russia where the state lies through its teeth to perpetuate its own power.
TIL you aren't allowed to go on the internet when you're above 55.  TIL you lost the ability to form your own opinions when you turn 55.  TIL /u/mekanosis is a dumbarse.
lol dumbarse sounds weird.
TIL that DBcrumpets is over 55, on the internet, can form his own 'opinions', and is mad because despite this, he still couldn't work out what was going on in the referendum fear campaign.
It's all good. Time and natural selection should take care of these old union fucking bastards.
And those for independence now will get older and more worried about their pensions ... 
Haha, you're funny. Thinking this generation will have pensions in the future. 
The retirement age will be pushed so far back we'll have died before retirement.
I know, I'm just absolutely gutted about the result and it is making me bitter and resentful. 
With lovely people like you backing the movement I can't see how Yes lost.
Sarcasm. Is that all you have in the tank? Look. I was angry, displaying anger in times like this is normal. I feel like my heart has been ripped out, so you can take your sarcasm elsewhere. 
Once in a generation?  Why what stops the referendum from being on the ballot again or is it like constitutionally only allowed once every X amount of years?
Because the general reaction to people asking to do it again would, not entirely unreasonably, be "AGAIN?!! You lost! Get over it!"  The UK is a nation of 60 million people. We can't all keep putting the entire nation's politics on hold to go through the same rigmarole repeatedly for the benefit of a small fraction of that total.
Well I mean it wasn't THAT small a fraction...Almost half the voters of Scotland were for it...right?
Even if there'd been a yes majority by 1% it would have hardly been a roaring mandate for independence
But a significant majority of No voters would be deid in a decade's time, so the mandate would grow stronger with time.....
And a new group of voters will be older, and more concerned about things like their own pensions.  Just because someone is a yes voter today, it doesn't mean they'll be one in 10 years.
In comparison to the population of the UK, yes, it's a tiny fraction. If I'm not mistaken, most English *counties* has more people living in them than Scotland does as a whole.
I don't see how's that totally relevant - I get what your saying of course great good blah blah blah ...I'm not from the UK, but that'd be like saying oh we don't care about what people want in Rhode Island because they have a smaller population than other states...wouldn't it sorta?
But the UK does care about what the people of Scotland want - they've made it clear what they want, and unless there's a really, really clear mandate for a referendum (e.g. the Scottish Nationalist Party winning another landslide), Westminster will do everything in their power to avoid having a referendum. 
You didn't let the South leave the Union.
Statehood is seen as permanent. The UK is not.
Totally different!    I think? The south was never independent, where as Scotland was.  I think today if an individual state wanted to become independent for whatever reason, and had the backing of its population it might be more peacefully allowed?  I think???  I doubt Obama would start a civil war over it.
That's not completely true, of course. The original 13 states were in fact independent at the outset, and only gradually formed a real union over the decade or so between the Declaration Of Independence and the Constitution.
What?  The original 13 states were never really independent of each other as far as I'm concerned..I know there was a lot of states rights people back then, but when push came to shove we all banded together for form a free and independent confederation of united states; united being the operative word...We were colonies of Great Britain, and then signed a declaration of Independence which identified us as "United" States.  Yes it says Free and Independent States in there I think somewhere (haven't read it in years), but we were "United" at the same time...  and the Articles of Confederation which loosely binded us together until their official ratification as well in 1777? Or maybe 1781? Or something like that.  I don't know I mean I guess you could look at it as if the States were all separate and independent of each other, in some ways they still are and still have states rights outside of federal involvement, but I think the idea was always that we would be a confederation/united group of states that all worked together for common goals etc.
No offense, but you're pretty foggy on your colonial American history. :-)
shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The is no legal way for a state to leave the union. I think its actively legislated against because a strong union needs it. If new york, California and Texas leave, the nation loses a quarter of its wealth. And yes, the civil war boils down that.
Yah but what if 99% of the population of a state wanted to leave the union...and the governor said ok this is what our people want....Goverment might say its not legal, but would they really send troops or start a war over it... Say Hawaii was like we want to be independent again...you don't think we'd work something out might take 50 years or something granted but eventually?  Something like fine, you can be independent but we're keeping our naval facilities...hypothetically?  I think we'd do this over war or even threatening war.
The original 13 colonies started a war when they had 33% popular support at the start. War wouldn't have to come from the federal government. The flexibility of the UK constitution let this vote happen quickly (we learned :p), which I think is awesome. And didn't need a pretty useless, do nothing legislative branch to spend years writing an amendment just to let freedom and democracy happen.

The Scottish independence side did not have all that great support before all this talk of a referendum. Remember, you guys are a Union too, some might get bored of Washington like many Scots are of Westminster.
...You've completely missed the point. The issue is that is disrupts the politics of the whole country: It takes up a lot of valuable time and attention that should be devoted to other major issues. The issue of Scottish Independence was raised, fair enough, but it has also been settled. To keep bringing it back up would be damaging to *everyone else*, as it would continue to distract from other, more pressing political concerns.  They had their chance. The answer was no. Now there's a million other problems to look at.
Oh yeah I mean I get that - I'm just saying to all the people bummed out about not being independent, it's not like you'll never have a chance at it again...right?  
It's just very unlikely.  Having another referendum would have to be approved by the people who wouldn't want Scotland to become independent in the first place.  In other words, this referendum was not just the SNP stating they would have a referendum, they had to receive permission from the UK government to do so.    Will the UK government grant this permission again anytime soon for a referendum of this kind when it is not in their best interest? Probably not.  It's akin to the United States Congress allowing Texas to vote on becoming their own country. 
Not now. Maybe in another 100 years once we're all dead, or maybe 200 years.
> We can't all keep putting the entire nation's politics on hold to go through the same rigmarole repeatedly   They did it for the Irish EU vote(s).
I agree with the sentiment but  >putting the entire nation's politics on hold  sounds a bit dramatic, and I don't think it's at all what happened.
It did, for at least the past two months.
Just 2 months at the end of a two year campaign. Could've been worse.
They literally skipped the last questions session to campaign up in Scotland. 
That's exactly what politics is....two groups of people continuously bickering and taking issues to vote. And I wouldn't call 45% a small fraction.

So just sweep a narrowly passed giant issue under the rug and do t speak of it ever again? Yeah...that always works.
10% is not that 'narrowly passed'. The Independence movement had a chance, they lost by a comfortable margin. Back to real issues.
Oh...so now this wasn't even a "real issue"?   And 10% IS a fairly narrow gap all things considered.
I don't understand where you are coming from. Part of the Yes campaign is how WM spend their money. Why on earth would they want them to keep spending the tax payers money on more vote. If they ask for another referendum soon and all that tax payers money gets spent again, the SNP will lose more votes, as they don't have Scotland's best interests at heart, they have their own.
Because this referendum wasn't a unilateral decision of the Scots, it was allowed by Westminster. Referendums are costly, tiresome, and polarize people, so they're not going to organize them on a whim. There would need to be an extremely clear reason for them to believe the Scottish people would vote differently for them to allow a new referendum.
There's no set limits. But there would have to be a step change in support for the concept in Scotland before it would ever be put the the vote again.   IMO and that of Alex Salmond the issue has been settled 'for a generation'.   Of course Salmond has just resigned so it's no longer up to him. 
I voted yes and I agree. In my mind 15 - 20 years is a fair enough wait.   We lost by a large enough margin that unless there's a massive sea change in opinion (eg, anger because westminster reneges on their more powers bribe, which might just be what swung it) we should leave it be for a good wee while.
15 - 20 years? I think 100 years is more realistic until people forget.
Tonight, george square 7pm, keep your eyes peeled
Good luck! :)
I'm not Scottish, but from what I understand, the British consitution is unwritten, and can be changed by a majority in Westminster at any time. This referendum has set a precedent, and so if Holyrood says it wants a referendum, it is unlikely Westminster would be able to deny it without seeming unjust, however, there are the following issues to consider;  * The SNP will always have the independence of Scotland as its leading policy. However, the SNP leader has stated this is a once in a generation opportunity, so it does seem they will bide their time before trying again. That said, the SNP "only" got ~45% of the vote in the Scottish election in 2011, if the SNP (or the SNP plus other independence supporting parties, I believe the Greens are yes, and more may follow) get ~60% in an election in a decade or so, I can imagine they would consider that as a mandate to try again.  * One of the most persuasive arguments has been the fact that Scotland would inherit almost all of the UKs share of North Sea oil and gas, giving it a far higher revenue per capita than the rest of the UK.So they would be able to use that money to invest in Scotlands future, reassuring those who worry about independent Scotland's finances. While there is still plenty of it out there, the profitability of it, and so the tax revenues, are inexorably declining. In a generation or so, it will be much harder for the yes campaign to sway the undecideds with optimism about Scotland's future, unless another big, reliable, revenue source is identified.  * The ball is in Westminster's court now. There was a no vote, but not as resounding as they hoped it would be, and all three of the leaders of the major Westminster parties have quite literally gone ["on the (Daily) Record"](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-ed-miliband-nick-4265992) as saying they promise to give significant new powers to Holyrood. If they back out, or fob Scotland off with some token bollocks like an extra few % tax varying powers, both yes and many no voters will be up in arms at the betrayal.
Just a note, Britain has no formally written and signed constitution on one piece of paper, however that I because the constitution is made up of a thousand years of documentation and legislation. Much more nuanced and resilient, and stops people arguing about what people meant hundreds of years ago, is that a comma or an ink drop.Its also the reason that Scotland could have a referendum to leave relatively easily.
In fact, the man who was hanged by a comma was a UK citizen.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Casement
That's more judicial, which is a whole different kettle of fish and way too many examples of this (one of the reasons I think the lack of a death penalty is a good thing). A good example, but relates to one man, one case, not the running of a country. I quite like the way the constitution is handled in the UK.
Westminster could probably deny a referendum any time within the next 20 years without much backlash.
We will vote again. I refused to be ignored.
You was not ignored, your vote counted.

China literally said that this referendum was an example of "too much democracy destabilizing the West".
Are you jumping up and down?
Well you can always do things the old fashioned way and simply murder all the No-voters as traitors. Violent oppression of the majority 55% by a minority 45%. Tyranny in other words. You know, the opposite of freedom.
I hope to god that this is a troll.
Trolling? I was just pointing out how Independence used to work.
This is true and it makes me sick. So ashamed of my cowardly compatriots. 
My friend put this status up and I couldn't have put it more eloquently if I tried.  "There has been a lot of agression from both the yes and no campaigns recently, much of it revolving around a certain opinion making you unscottish or unpatriotic. With the vote in, Scotland has made its decision; democracy has played its part. For anyone in the yes campaign to further challenge no voters or for any further agression to continue from either party IS unpatriotic. Not saying "well good, Scotland got what Scotland wanted" will only prove that you didn't want what Scotland wanted - only what you did"
Do you ever think you might be a bit boisterous and vocal at times?
A lot of the time. 
Yeah mate, bingo, I voted no because I love being rogered by Westminster.  Jesus, I'm so sick of 'yes' idiots romanticising this referendum. We have freedom. We're not slaves; we're in a union with countries that our ancestors helped to form, and fought two world wars with; our MPs sit in Westminster helping to dictate United Kingdom policy. And now we have been offered even more control of our policy and budget. We're still free, we're still Scottish. Fuck throwing everything away for one big gamble (and that's what it was) on the basis of bullshit unsupported, debatable, or flat out false information - or Braveheart nationalistic cack about freedom. This referendum was quite possibly the greatest display of democracy in history.
I would have voted yes, if I could vote.  I admit to being a romantic. But I appreciate what you wrote, and, yes, it was an incredible demonstration of democracy that couldn't happen in most countries of the world. Slàinte mhath.
This is why the referendum was a NO. too much blind patriotism by Alex Salmon

Absolutely sickened and disgusted by today's so-called result. Being from so-called Northern Ireland I was hoping to see the beginning of the end of the so-called United Kingdom. But, as Mahatma Gandhi said, "When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always."
tl;dr Butthurt he's part of a minority.
shut ur word hole lmao. just lol at people who are too scared te take their own destiny inte their own hands. u wouldn't say that to the irish man myself in real life or you'd get torn up like a kleenex in snot city and absolutely physically destroyed. lmao im not upset at all im just sittin here in comfort knowin that, as ghandi once said, "there have always been tyrants and murderers but in the end they always fall. think of it --always".
I would then report you to the police and press charges.
lmao mate id get away scot free yafeelme from the so-called police. lol ive already been on Traffic Cops, Police Interceptors and Brit Cops and nothin happened to me. But at the end of the day as gandhi once said, "When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always."
Stop being such a colossal twat.
:)
We won't have an independent Scotland before 2050. The false consensus bias online makes people underestimate the NO movement. 
Come on man. I was about as yes voting as you can get, but I'm genuinely happy regardless of the outcome. The people of Scotland are more politically tuned in than they have ever been. Not to mention that the vote we have just had in Scotland is going to change the UK forever. We'll be getting new powers, England will be getting new powers, there is really not much to be upset about.
More 'powers' for everyone!
Yes,  and we'll still have nukes only thirty miles from our largest conurbation,  not to mention an ocean of oil we can't utilise because of the to-ing and fro-ing of those nuclear submarines.  Wonderful isn't it. 
Yeah life's a bitch.
And Reddit beats watching  TV with the wife. 
Sure does.
were you willing to die for the cause like me? don't give me all this here non sense about the yes vote if ye weren't willing te die for the cause. not much to be upset about lmao yees had ur one chance and yees couldnt take ur destiny into ur own hands. id would have happily died for the cause today if it meant the beginning of the end of the so-called united kingdom. but at least the words of Gandhi will allow me to continue living, "When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always."
I think you need to get some perspective.
All I keep thinking of is this scene from GoW ...  [What have you done?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-EKvujjX4)

Basically Scotland held a referendum (popular vote amongst it's citizens) to decide whether or not it should break away from the rest of the UK and form an independent sovereign country on it's own. The vote decided a 'No', albeit by a small margin. Hope that helps, probably wouldn't have been too hard to google though.
[deleted]
Yes, they're part of the UK.  Now, this can get a bit tricky. When 'country' is normally said in a conversational context, people are referring to a sovereign state - one of the main prerequisites for this being it possesses autonomy (to have full control of it's laws). So in this sense, the UK is a country. However, the UK is made up of four main regions, the ones you have named. Due to history (the unification of different countries into the UK scattered through time), they have traditionally been called countries, but they are in some senses more akin to the provinces you have in canada (despite a political structure that differs in a whole bunch of ways). A quick summary would be the UK is the 'country' and the 4 areas in the UK are it's 'constituent countries'. There's also a bunch of crown dependencies and oversea territories, but it's not necessary to delve into that to get a basic understanding :) Hope this explains a bit of the origins of the terms too, and that I didn't ramble on *too* much.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/British_Isles_Euler_diagram_15.svg/1260px-British_Isles_Euler_diagram_15.svg.png  This picture simplifies and explains it. British Islands (not republic of Ireland) all answer to a central government. So when we say we are "british" we could be English, Scottish or Welsh. Calling British people English (unless they are English) is an insult to many people

Just saw an article from the New York Times, as of three minutes ago. Apparently the "yes" campaigners have effectively conceded? 
Bbc called it a no two hours ago. It's over. 
Gotcha, thanks. Not sure why that didn't come up on Google - the NYT article was the only thing I saw that wasn't "yup, votes are being counted". 
It's apparently been unofficially over for a little while now, going by the state of the threads. But it's past seven there so I think it's official now. Now here's to hoping they don't do what Americans do when politics become so sharply divided and start tearing into each other. It'd really be the finishing move on showing the rest of us up if the two camps can reconcile and work together from here on out. 
Geez, I hope so.   I'm pretty ignorant of the situation, as an American, but I saw someone yesterday suggesting that the best outcome would be "no", but a vote that was still close - to essentially put pressure on the government to address the concerns raised. That made some sense to me, although I don't know if it was close enough for that?   Hope things work out well over there one way or another. 
If you want to see how the conversation develops from these results, follow /r/unitedkingdom for a while. This referendum has changed a hell of a lot, even if it was a no. There are strong calls for a federal UK now, since Scotland is getting newly promised devolved powers.
Great suggestion - thanks! 
Likewise. It will be interesting where it goes from here and what'll be the changes Scotland institutes now if they are indeed granted fuller governance. I'm also hoping for some intense analysis about what the most decisive facets were, but they apparently don't have exit polling so it could take a little while before that information is definitively known.

How much of the vote was due to cultural dilution and assimilation do you think? I remember when the Falklands Islands voted to stay a UK territory I was left wondering why the vote was ever bothered with. Seems like you guys were only ever given the option to vote one way or the other when it was already a forgone conclusion what the result would be.

Even if you don't really like Irn Bru, I think there is something to be proud of in that the most popular soft drink in Scotland is made in Scotland.
I adore the taste of "cola" (fentimans being my favorite, Pepsi max when it's on offer and tesco xero cola otherwise) but am also glad that irn bru is the top seller. Trying new flavours of soft drink is always fun, when they do well we're likely to get more unusual flavours.    I really wish there was a sugar free Red Kola though. 
I think Red Kola is one of the drinks Barrs have reduced the sugar content in already. 16kcal per 100ml compared to 42kcal per 100ml for regular Irn-Bru.
840 calories for a 2L of Irn-bru. Fucks sake.
I used to wonder why I gained weight drinking almost two litres of the stuff a day. Now I know.
> 840**k** calories for a 2L of Irn-bru. Fucks sake.  
Yeah but when people talk about nutritional calories they mean kcal.  So it's not like recommended calorie intake is 2000-2500 and 2l of Irn Bru has 840,000.
Ah, OK. TBH I ignore all those numbers as they can only bring me news I don't want to hear.
As they say, ignorance is bliss.
Interesting. I may be able to justify buying the stuff for myself as a rare treat!
Barr have already added artificial sweeteners to most of their drinks besides Irn Bru.  The pineappleade, cream soda, bubblegum and red kola all contain a mix of ace-k/aspartamine & sugar afaik.  :( 
Or cherryade
I'm English and think it's very tasty
You're not allowed to like it

Yup, I don't really like it (I know, burn him, he's a heretic) but the first thing I did when I spotted that post was search out the original tweet and re-tweet it - for that very reason.
... from girders
I'm from Atlanta. I'm proud that the most popular beverage in the world is made here
Aye well I'm from Atlantis, and you aw drink our pish
You live in yer pish but 
He's fae Atlantis mate, nae Dundee
lmfao
well to be fair, they make cocacola everywhere
The most popular beverage in the world is water, regardless of what this screenshot of a reply to a tweet posted on Reddit tells you.  But if you're referring to Coke, I'm like 99.9% certain it's regionally made, they don't make it in ATL and ship it to India.
Just settle down there, Barrel o' Laughs. 
Atlanta is the home of coke is what he means, that is where coke hq is.
And tea and coffee will both outsell cola by an insane margin as well
Speaking of India, have you ever tried Thums (sic) Up Cola? God that stuff is amazing.

Scotland and the US! A bubbly bond 
Rest of the world doesn't have a clue what it's missing out on 
As an American who ordered some Irn-Bru to justify a small but necessary Amazon order, it's AMAZING and I'm so sad that it's relatively expensive.
Better move to Scotland then 
Yeah, that shit comes out of the taps there man.
Or Russia
Just St Petersburg and Moscow areas I think. Never seen it North of St Petersburg.
Doesn't most of Russia live South of St. Petersburg?
I could get it in some supermarkets in Novosibirsk when I lived there.
I stand corrected. Got family in the Kola Peninsula and not seen it up there yet.
I found it in a dollar store in Saratov, which is not a really big city. I never tried it before and I loved it! But now I can't get it where I live (in Holland) unfortunately :(
Who's your bru guy? I'll undercut him 
Amazon as I said, it's not even the shipping because of prime. $16 bucks for a 6 pack is too rich for my blood right now.
You're being charged way more than it actually costs, probably as it's being exported. 
You don't say, mate 😂
He's saying "it's not the shipping" because of Amazon Prime suggesting that it's just that Irn Bru is expensive. What part am I missing here? 
American Amazon just charges a fucktonne for Irn Bru, think of the price of Irn Bru from a Chinese take-away.
They do the same for us with Lucky Charms, fiver a box.
That's about right here too if you get a decent sized box and it's not on sale.
It's the small box and fiver is approx $8 i think.
You're missing that costs involved drive up the price of the product itself rather than just being reflected in a larger shipping fee.
You're being charged way more than it actually costs too, if you're thinking about it that way 
Are you sure?
He's pitting two bru dealers against each other
4 liters from scotmid for 1.50 people
Aye but does it come in a glass bottle? 
Naw only downside 
Pity. I'm off to the states the morra and had to settle for a couple of wee plastic ones in my suitcase. No ideal but you have to make do with what you've got. 
Thats it just make sure its chilled first 
No question
Might get taken off you E124 is banned in America I think :O
So I've heard, but I think it's legal if it's only a small amount for personal use. There'll be hell to pay if they nick it anyway
You're allowed to be a Nazi but god forbid if you have a few E numbers. 
And if you've ever been caught with E your banned for life.
A suitcase full of E's could give yo an interesting time with customs...
that is glorious, most i can get is 2L for £1 here (london)
Still a good price 
indeed 
E124 is banned in America, can you still buy drinks with it in?
Which is ironically funny considering what the US Food industry gets away with.
As a fellow American... YOU CAN ORDER IRN BRU FROM AMAZON??  Oohhh I've been desperate to try this stuff for years
I was so jazzed to hear there were places in my home town in Canada that sold Irn Bru, only to find out its a different recipe, because the government of Canada doesn't like some ingredient in Irn Bru (not sure what ingredient, just what I was told).  Edit: I googled it and it was some food colouring. Which is weird, I didn't think the lack of a food colouring makes it taste so different. 
caffeine is the difference.  some rules used to be here about spiking drinks with caffeine not being cool if the drink didn't already have it normally.  that's why irn bru made in canada is decaff and why our mountain dew was decaff too.  may have been specifically about citrus'y drinks.
but what is it? pop? beer? energy drink? I'd be willing to try some if I could get my hands on it
Just to clarify, it's not orange flavoured, just orange colour! 
Okay, so what the hell does it taste like? Or is it so unique that it's difficult to describe?
From the back of my bottle here.   "bru'd in Scotland since 1901 to a secret recipe of 32 flavours with a spirit that's as bold as its taste. You can't describe it, because there's nothing like it."   I agree, I can't describe it haha.
Bullshit. Tastes like gurders obviously.
Ginger and bubblegum
Yep, though I'd say tutti-fruitti rather than bubblegum but those are similar flavours anyway.  One thing that's interesting about Irn Bru is that the temperature of the drink noticeably changes its flavour; the colder it is the more it tastes of ginger, the warmer it is the stronger the bubblegum/tutti-fruitti flavour gets.
Interesting, can imagine that being tasty, does it have a bite, or is it more smooth sweet.  Thanks!
It has a bite but mostly because it's very fizzy, I prefer it when it's just a bit flat. 
It's not spicy like ginger if that's what you mean. When you have a hangover it tastes like the elixir of life.
It's kinda got a bubble gum meets tropical punch flavor to it.
It is a unique taste, definitely.  To me it's more pineapple than orange, with a faint bitter tang (like bitter lemon only not nearly so strong).  I love it, but I rarely see it where I live so I don't get to drink it very often.
It is not fruity at all not even in a 'fruit flavoured' way. That is really misleading. I love it but it tastes completely artifical. 
I know, it's not really fruity, but it was a bit pineapply to me.
Like a sweet ginger
Tastes like candy to me.
irn bru?  it's an orange caffeinated carbonated soft drink.
its fucking pure gold mate is what it is.
It is also a life saving medicine on Sunday Mornings.
I'm moving to glasgow from Western Canada next month and I'm going to buy truckloads of this stuff. Seriously one of the things I'm most excited for!
I was gonna say that is a bit sad when you are moving to such a wonderful place, it's only a fizzy drink that'll rot your teeth. Then I saw you were moving to Glasgow. And yeah Irn-Bru is probably all you have to look forward to.
He might also like rain.
Should be a fun two years :) I actually do like rain because we don't get a lot here. I'm prepared to eat my words.
Are you coming on a work holiday thing or to study? It does rain a lot in Glasgow but it's still mostly a nice place to be.
I'll be coming in on a contract for about two years. I'll have to get an umbrella!
I'm from the rest of the world, what drink am I missing, exactly ?
IRN BRU, GETS YE THRU
🤔 my fud senses are tingling
Quality Patter/10
Look at the picture and who in that picture is the poster
Barry's Red Cola.
I love Irn-Bru, I wish it was bottled in the US but until then I can't keep paying $6-7 per a 12oz can.  And yes I've had the real thing in Scotland, shit was delicious.  
Irn-Bru is available in the vast majorit of shops in England and is pretty popular.  Scottish people always seem to think England is some far off land. I've had two Scottish friends visit who wer shocked you oculd get Irn-Bru so easily. And three who were surprised that Tunnock's Caramel and Teacakes are sold at most supermarkets. Yet they are all have moaned that you couldn't get potator scones or square sausage, which for some reason they did expect.   Also just to burst everyone's bubble. The coca-cola company massively outsells barr, by miles, it's only that they don't sell a single individual drink that is more popular than Irn-bru. Infact there are even claims that Irn-Bru only competes with coca-cola and does not significantly lead like the marketing suggests as smaller studies have suggested that Irn-bru is not that far ahead/not number one, and if you pay attention all the claims about it being so are normally unsourced or sourced to Barr themselves who partly base it on estimates.  Irn-bru is fucking great though. 
Yep! My friend's Scottish friend came down to London to stay years ago and we were chatting to some Spanish girls and he was saying that Irn Bru is a uniquely Scottish thing that you cant get in England blah blah blah. I loved Irn Bru when I was a child  (in South West England) and he told me I must be getting Irn Bru mixed up with Tizer or something. I left the pub and came back 3 minutes later with 4 cans of Irn Bru, which the Spanish girls didnt like.   Definitely can get potato scones in England.
Fuckin cock blocked.
Coke doesn't make scrumpy.
I've tried it, pretty awful stuff
Banned. Banned immediately!
I bet he eats S***D to
Salad?
Steady.
I'm gonna fight you 
I'll try another one. Last one I had was room temperature and tasted like garbage
Make sure you have a chilled can AND have a hangover. Then you'll see my friend, then you'll see.
Chilled can? Gless boatle mate.
I was working on the assumption he wasn't from God's Country and may not have the funds to get a glass bottle where he is. Also, I don't think he'd know what to do with the bottle once he's finished drinking it.
We were all left bereft with the great bottle ban of '15.
I do not think that your blasphemy will be well received around here...
how dare you
How to piss off an entire nation in one quick sentence
South Australia also outsold Coca-cola sales 3-1 to the godly FUIC!  "Farmers Union Iced Coffee outsold Coca-Cola in South Australia at a rate of almost 3:1, with South Australians consuming 36 million litres, making it the only place in the world where a milk drink outsells a cola product,[2][3] and one of the few places where Coca-Cola is not the most popular locally consumed bottled beverage, a success shared only by Inca Kola in Peru and Irn-Bru in Scotland"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Union_Iced_Coffee
**Farmers Union Iced Coffee**  Farmers Union Iced Coffee is a flavoured milk drink popular in Australia, primarily the state of South Australia. It continues to be sold under the "Farmers Union" banner, originally a South Australian co-operative, subsequently the listed company National Foods, and then by a series of subsidiaries of the Japanese brewing company Kirin. The current manufacturer's company name is Lion Dairy & Drinks.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Scotland/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

Is Pepsi not more popular than Coke in a bunch of countries?
No.
According to Wikipedia, 🅱️epis is more popular in [India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Guatemala, Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#Rivalry_with_Coca-Cola).  
**Pepsi: Rivalry with Coca-Cola**  According to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores, in what was called the "Pepsi Challenge". These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi (which is believed to have more lemon oil, and less orange oil, and uses vanillin rather than vanilla) to Coke. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the "Challenge" across the nation.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Scotland/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24
According to this map which is a BBC study it's not.
The map is probably wrong. Even the Irn-bru claim is iffy if you look at the sources for that claim (i.e. there are none or it's a tiny sampe or it's barr's own claim based on predictions). I've looked and I can't find a decent source.
> Even the Irn-bru claim is iffy  A cursory glance of the bins around any school in Glasgow will more than back up the claim
Yes, You're wrong. Try research before blindly stating bullshit. 
AFAIK Kofola is way more popular in Slovakia than Coca Cola. Every pub I was ever in there had it, on draft, and it was far more visible in shops too.
I was there this year and it looks like Coke is trampling over the small man, and winning.  Compared to a couple of years ago when Kofola appeared to be drunk everywhere. Now most bars had Coca Cola and shops had prominent Coca Cola concessions. The power of having an unlimited marketing budget! 
That's sad to hear, I much prefer Kofola. :(
The only reason Coca Cola took over in Germany is because they made their own version of Spezi and called it Mezzo Mix
Bullshit, Coke is MUCH more popular than Spezi in Germany. In most german restaurants and fast food places you can't even get Spezi (except for in Bavaria).
Is Fanta still popular in Germany?
Yeah, with kids.
And in Charlottesville.
Ayyyyyyy
Too soon?
Bro I was all over Baden-Wuttemburg and Spezi was EVERYWHERE
Because it's the other Bavaria... Go north of the Weißwurstäquator and nobody cares about Spezi.
You can get it everywhere in NRW too.
Bremen here. Even the cheap Asian all you can eat had spezi/mezzo
> Weißwurstäquator  Don't remember this being common at all around Stuttgart? I do like me a Weisswurst though. How does a Bayerisch Fruhstuck go again? Ein Radi, ein Weisswurst und ein bier? Maybe a pretzl added to the mix?
well, it's popular in the important parts of germany at least :P  (nur Spaß, ihr seid alle Schwaben aber wir lieben euch trotzdem <3)
They sell coca cola in North Korea? 
Officially not in Cuba or North Korea but yes both have lots of Coke. North Korea comes via China. Not sure about Cuba. 
When I was in Cuba, the Coca Cola was all the Mexican stuff. Saying that, TuKola was a big thing as well, being the state made cola. Was good shite. 
What do they make cubs libres with then? 
Dunsade
Cuban-manufactured cola.
Pretty sure I saw a video a while back where some lad went on holiday to NK, and visited a grocery store that had a bunch of American groceries in it.
Coca-Cola is one of the most resilient companies on earth - wars, famines, dictators don't put them off. They managed to operate in Somalia throughout the period when Somalia had no govt and was run by war-lords (they bought their ingredients and paid wages using verbal contracts enforced by elders trusted by all the war-lords).  A big clue that something bad was happening in Venezuela was when Coca-Cola pulled out of Venezuela on May 2016 because they couldn't get sugar. When Coke can't make things work, your economy is in real trouble.
Great story about a pair of French adveturers crossing the Congo in a 4x4 Land Cruiser. They got stuck hundreds of miles from any large town and had to satellite phone out for a spare part. They stayed in the nearest jungle village for weeks. Toyota couldn't deliver, FedEx had no way though, DHL had no chance. Until one day a villager roared "COCA COLA! The man will come soon!". The bi-annual delivery of Coca Cola was due soon. they managed to get in touch with the Congolese Coca Cola Rep and sure enough their spare Toyota part was dropped off at a seaport and made its way to them in the back of a decrepit ex Soviet Coca Cola truck.   tl/dr - Coca Cola is EVERYWHERE!
Ici, c'est Pepsi!  -60% of the province of Québec
And if Scotland can be mapped differently to the rest of the UK, it doesn't seem unreasonable to say that Quebec could be mapped differently to the rest of Canada.
why would we be, our leading party are just made of a bunch of corrupt federalist sellouts? And we can't get rid of them because the other superior option happen to be the seperatists, soo..
Both are component parts of a larger country, both have strong separatist movements, and indeed both have had independence referenda which failed.
implying that they aren't already their own countries/nations  EDIT: oh wait im dumb thats not your comment at all cheers mate have a good one jolly ho anglo anglo
Scotland is it's own country. Quebec isn't.   It would be like including London as it's own thing, Londoners would love it and think it was necessary but in reality they are just another other number when it comes to national statistics.  
> Scotland is it's own country. Quebec isn't.   Based on what - having existed as an independent country over three hundred years ago?  Both have their own cultures, both have their own elected legislatures (which in both cases have a substantially different composition to the national parliament which they are represented in), both have separatist parties.  And I don't think I'd try telling the PQ they are any less devoted to seeing their nation exist as a separate sovereign state than the SNP are.  
Based on facts and reality mate.   Scotland is it's own country which is part of the federation of several countries known as the UK. If it stays in the UK it is still it's own country.   Quebec is just part of Canada that wishes it wasn't.   It's nothing to do with wanting it more. It's an objective fact.  You'd think someone posting on /r/Scotland arguing about Scotland being a country would know what Scotland and the UK are and why they are not just British analogues of Quebec and Canada.   >Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland  >[Quebec is a]  province of Canada  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec  Montreal and Quebec city are cities in that province in that country. Canada is a country, not a federation of different countries like the UK.  The similarity between Quebec and Scotland is that both have lots of people who want to be a sovreign state. That doesn't change the fact that Scotland is a country whether they leave the UK or not, and Quebec will remain as a province unless they ever do get independence. 
> Based on what  Do Quebec have a team at the world cup? Naw! 
Neither do Scotland :'(
But [we'll always have this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opsudWaeNqk).
They do at the rugby!
Barr's cream soda for me.  Irn Bru doesn't float my boat.
Moray Cup is preferable to Irn-Bru for me
How rare is Moray Cup? Because I was in a conference with some English people and they had no idea what it was, tried to explain it, tried to buy some, could not find any in the center of Edinburgh at the time :/ no probs in Aberdeenshire 
I always thought it was weird that there were two black dudes on the label in a hot climate, drinking some yellow liquid. But Moray Cup is red and sold in Scotland. What's going on there?
These questions were always in my mind as a child and I still don't know is the answer! It's part of the nostalgia and mystery. The best drink for sure. Also some co-ops sell it in the drink chiller
Nobody knows, it adds to the mystery though...  
Aye, I'm up in Aberdeen, it's easily found from the Highlands to Dundee, outside of these areas, pretty difficult
[deleted]
Nah it's sold in Dundee for sure, or at least it used to be. Pretty sure I got it in Asda a few years ago.
The coop on Albert street sells it.
That's where I got it on the drive up from England
I work for a wholesaler and we stock it but it's rare it's on a van other than the Aberdeen or Dundee runs. It looks peculiar compared to other labels, looks like a sort of dandelion and burdock style drink but never got round to trying it, quite intrigued now. Only other thing that springs to mind concerning them is the wee diddy 250ml bottles are in annoying 2x6 format as opposed to easier 4x3 style, and are a pain in the tits to stack neatly for all situations.   I've quite a sweet tooth, but dandelion and burdock isn't my cuppa. What is moray cup like? 
Similar to Red Kola I'd say. 
Doesn't taste like D & B at all, it's most similar to Tizer I think but tastes completely different.  You can get it in normal 500ml bottles up here too.
It's rare as hens teeth south of the cairngorms. I'd never heard of it before moving to Elgin (central belt until my late twenties). I'm in Dundee now and it's nowhere to be seen. 
It's made in macduff in Aberdeenshire
I knew that, got a friend who works for Macb
So why moray cup when it's made just outside Moray?
Pretty rare, only get it in Aberdeenshire and Moray I think.  
I'm in Glasgow and Asda sell it for about 45p for 2L.  I'm not often in Asda but whenever I have been they've had it in the juice aisle next to the other smaller selling ones.
> Moray Cup  Never heard of it. All the Barr soft drinks are common in England though, especially Irn-Bru.  
Hated it as a kid, love it now. 
I haven't had it in a long time.  But, I'm going to the shop tomorrow to get some.
Barrs appleade. Yes please. 
I don't know what it is, but Barr's cream soda is the only drink I prefer out of the can as opposed to a glass. 
I love Irn Bru, but Barr's Cream Soda is my favourite. Especially if it's a little flat.
Mon the Currie Cola!
I call bullshit. The most popular drink in Peru is Inca Cola. Coca-Cola lags far behind.
From wikipedia:  >In Peru, the Inca Kola trademark is owned by Corporación Inca Kola Perú S.A., which since 1999[7] is a joint venture between the Coca-Cola Company and the Lindley family 
Oh shit
Honestly, it's the thing I most look forward to whenever I'm back to visit my family.  Well, that and my family. 
And my heart fills with patriotism.
Inaccurate. North Korea is normally greyed out on these types of maps lads. Get it right. Our pals over a /r/Pyongyang also hate Coca-Cola 
You better believe it!
It also doesn't help that coca cola company has bought most of the competition. 
funny map but I'm fairly certain it's wrong
It's actually true.  Heres a video by the BBC  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zgQPZV31cAU#t=812   At 13:30
Thought it was Inca Kola in Peru?
I gather coca-cola owns Inca Kola now.
Inca Cola looks to be owned in Peru by a joint venture between Coca-Cola and some other company with Coca-Cola having exclusive rights to it outside of Peru so I think it's fair enough to have it red on this map.
It's probably, I suspect, that there are more popular drinks than coke but coke is global as one recognised thing. Most places might actually not sell as much of their stuff overall but because all the other drinks might be made by a multitude of different smaller local brands that cocacola products nationwide sell better than any one other brand.  So basically it might not be the overall best selling one but it will be the best selling brand. That's also to remember it's not strictly coke but it's everything else they own and they own different brands in different places.  North Korea still baffles me but I'm not going down that googling rabbit hole on a Thursday night. 
In theory yes sure, but I think what's happened here is someone's taken the “Scotland's the only place in world where Coca-Cola isn't the top-selling soft drink” out of context and naïvely filled in a map based on it, rather than using actual data. There's surely caveats to that statement.  At the very least, I doubt we have sales figures for North Korea or Western Sahara…
:)
Irn Bru is pretty good
Barr's Irn Bru, made in Scotland from girders!
Fake news Inka cola is the most popular soda in Perú
Owned by Coca Cola :/
The adverts are fuckin' quality tae.
We have to enjoy it while we can before the new sugar rules come into effect. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-39126970

Aye, not a fan of the sugar free, by Xtra is pretty good.
Coke zero mate.

Nooooooooooooo :(
irn bru and munchie box
Coca Cola is the most popular drink in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea according to this map.
safe to say, Coca cola is the most popular drinks company in the world then.
Not true, Cuba doesn't officially sell coca cola and they have a state run drinks company that do decent stuff.
One of my favourite factoids that the Scots love Irn Bru so much.   And wait, is everyone missing the joke?
I like to imagine the Coca Cola boardroom with the map of the world and a question mark on Scotland, with everyone trying to understand what they can do to outsell Irn Bru. 
Czech and Slovak republics should be blue too. Most popular drink there is Kofola.
Here in the US, coke is popular as a base ingredient in mixed drinks, IE Jack & Coke (mostly because jack is shit and needs the help) is there a popular Bru based cocktail?
Not really any cocktails, it's a common mixer for vodka though.  Sometimes cheap whisky too, it's gingery so works well with it.      
 Irn bru is the best. 
Irn-bru is honestly the ONLY fizzy drink I consume regularly. I always have a bottle or two at home.  But I live in Paris and the fucking thing costs a fortune. 
Recently   Edit:  Inka cola is owned by a Mexican company 
As a Spanish person, Irn Bru is alright. All of my friends who tried it found it disgusting, though
Somethings off. When I visited India i was told Pepsi was multiple times bigger than Coke over there, same with Sudi and Pakistan. Was that just a lie? 
Even in the Black and Caspian Sea. Something tells me this is forged. 
/r/mapporncirclejerk
This map is bullshit
MATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. GUARANA ANTARCTICA FROM BRAZIL IS THE FUCKING BEES KNEES.
Coca-Cola and McDonald's are the only 2 companies that can never go bankrupt... look it up it's crazy lol 
This map is clearly forgetting that Pepsi makes Mountain Dew. I live in Georgia and that shit comes out of the faussets. 
[deleted]
I'm not 100% what mean
This graph conveys nothing about consumption levels of any soft drink. Only relative sales between brands.

I refuse to enter a union until they drop the 'e'.
I for one believe we should hold a referendum over it. Let the people decide as they always know best
The people have decided to add a Q....ok, who let the English vote?
WHISQY
Could have been worse. The Welsh word is 'chwisgi.'
That explains a lot
Is this honestly the result of a Scottish guy bringing whisky down to Wales and having everyone drink 2 bottles before he told them what it was called? This being the closest they could remember?
WHYISQ?
Sounds like a question where the only answer is 'yes'. 
Naw. Shite chat 
>who let the English vote?  And you've won the day. This is the best quote I've seen among all the funny shit today. Sums it up perfectly.
I hope that from now on this is what the English will be known for, like the French and how quickly they supposedly surrender.
damn straight! ill drop my pants as you drop your "e's" 
....riskey.
Dropping "e" will certainly result in everyone getting along. 
Farage should probably drop an e or two. Might actually enlighten the Frog faced cunt.
I was going to suggest dropping the English word altogether and just going with "uisce beatha" but it seems we can't even agree on how to spell that!
Is that the Irish term? In Scottish Gaelic it's uisge beatha, so we're still going to be arguing over one letter.
Scottish here. I actually prefer the Irish term (heinous I know). I say we let our Irish brethren have this one 
ah here, lads sure look at this, our peaceful little union is going great already! a lot better than our ehem *union* with the English thats for sure.
You're a good lad, and I bet you've got great craic 
I hear Glasgow has a terrible problem with stabbings and a horrible accent, not only that but apparently people like to get absolutely fucked and fight people on a Saturday night, is that true?  Because if it is, thats the exact reputation my city in Ireland has, we're just all so alike <3
Horrible accent aye, but Glasgow is actually a really nice place. Arseholes go about stabbing cunts in my eyes, hopefully we can do away cunts like them in the CU
Send them to England with the rest of the "Cunts" haha
Here now lads, we have a fix for this already, whiskey will be "uisca beatha" for the Irish and scotch of the Scots. Just think about it, we'll make millions to tourists who don't understand. 
'Water of life' for those that don't know how whiskey got its name.
Can't we just call it "Breakfast"?
So let me get this straight, we drop e and you join us for the party? Let's do this.
Ma man. Our collective livers would take a pounding if we united, but would be worth it.
I'm on the other side of the pond and am just stopping by after the decision, but I'll say this: I'm a fan of all forms of distilled spirits aged in wooden barrels. The 'e' denotes the heritage and style of the whisky and the history it comes from. The two terms can exist, let them both stay. Throwing away their words is a step towards throwing away their history. I wouldn't want to live in a world with less choices of drink. And if the stereotypes are true, either of you lot would either.
Do it or it's a fight.
In situations like these, I think it's best to piss off both parties equally and come up with a spelling that's different from both.
Wizquay by Georgio Armani
Wiskie
Let's all drop some E, it'll make the night last longer.
Nah, it's the lack of 'e' that makes whisky so superior to whiskey.
Why not keep both?  Two export commodities instead of one‽
Appalachian region chiming in. Can contribute bourbon. Our highlands were settled by Scots and Irish settlers and they brought folk music, confusing accents and slang, deep fried food and whisk(e)y with them. We're a bunch of labor class and farming types who already endure the same stereotypes on our continent as you do on yours. Can we be a part of the new commonwealth?   We'll bring tributes from the new world - chorizo, tequila, buffalo sauce, jive-ass turkeys, painted saw blades, clam chowder, red fire hydrants, public drinking fountains, free drink refills, watermelon, charming contractions like 'y'all', and buttered grits - in exchange for a passport and political asylum from whatever shapeshifting lizard gets elected to the White House this November. Oh, and save some blackcurrant jam for us please. Thanks in advance, I'll start drawing up the paperwork.

We were meant to be mate   The Celtic Confederation 
The Greater Dalriadan Republic
:D
On the other hand, the last time our countries collaborated, it resulted in Mrs Brown's Boys.. So maybe it's not such a great idea after all...
You can't have a Celtic confederation without the Welsh. 
We could give it a good try though.
A Gaelic Confederation then?
but then it would make the map look bad
Well maybe the Welsh shouldn't have voted for Little England
Can we have Brittany instead? How did Cornwall and the Manx vote?
Isle of Man is not part of the UK. It's a crown dependency like Jersey and Guernsey.  Cornwall voted "leave", bizarrely.
How does Brexit effect them the Isle of Man then? Was it technically part of the EU before the vote? Did they even get a vote?
They didn't get a vote because they are not part of the UK (they are a crown dependency), but Brexit will inevitably effect them as it will effect their primary trading partner. They are not an EU member.

That's...actually not that weird of an idea. Huh.
I just looked at street view on both sides, and you'd have to pave a highway through some beautiful land, so on second thought, don't do this. 
All our motorways get paved through beautiful land
Which is why it should be preserved. I recommend travel via giant catapults and parachutes. Or maybe ferries and airplanes if you want to be all boring about it. 
Underground tunnels!  In fact, lets build everything underground! We can join the faeries and burrow away from all these other fuckers.

But you'd have to drive to Campbelltown, and everyone knows that's like a 300 million mile drive from anywhere! 
There's the new ferry to Campbelltown.  You could get that to go on the bridge...
Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. Maybe for transporting goods, but considering that we're both island nations, it's easier to just ship it.
From the Penis of Scotland to the Anus of Ireland.
Turn the map of Ireland on its side & it looks like a cow. Waterford has the pleasure to be the anus. Enjoy your stay.
problem is the weather. the North sea is a beast when it wants to be. A tunnel like the Channel would be more stable, but more expensive
I love this! I'm in, build the bridge! 
We could go for the New Zealand thing. North and South islands. And in the meantime while we're figuring out the details we can all get together and dig a nice big sea trench between us and the English.
We can fill it with sharks, only to make damn sure we scare them off, they'll be foreign sharks. Immigrant sharks if you will.
Definitely not ex-pat sharks then?
Or do the Denmark/Sweden thing and just have a big fuck off bridge.
As a Swede I can recommend to opt for the ''fuck off bridge option''. Just don't do it with the English, that's where we went wrong. We built a bridge to the Danes.. ^^_danskjävlar_
Would building it to the Finns have been much better?
Yes. Then we could expand our import of swedish speaking finns to host our TV shows with their silky smooth voices.

Would you guys be willing to accept migrants from desolate places, stuck in a horrible situation?    Like, say, Newcastle...
You boys have the ferry to Amsterdam don't you? You're in.
>Like, say, Newcastle...  Pah. The imperialists down in London may CALL South Scotland "Northern England" but honestly, everything that was one Northumbria existed once in a Scottish context, answering to the local church authority at Iona and such. The ancient capitol of Northumbria is only a scant 10 miles from the Scottish border.  Surely the natural southern border of Scotland lies at the Humber, and not the Tweed.  Should southern Scots wish to accept Scotland's embrace once again, I think it would be the duty of an independent Scotland to attempt to rescue them, their territory, and that last 5% or so of the north sea oil from the grasping clutches of the imperial south.
I am totally up for you taking Yorkshire with you.
I think London wants to leave too, just saying. 
So long as indy Scotland has similar immigration laws to Ireland... I can use my Scottish Grandfather to get a passport har har.
[deleted]
On almost every level, it's easier to justify, than the actual UK.  - Similar cultures? Aye. (We have the same cultural roots) - Similar social attitudes? Aye. (We have similar sense of humour, although I find the Irish to be funnier) - Similar political leanings? Aye. (We just proved that in the EU vote) - Strong common history? Aye. (We both have strong Gaelic history) - Similar respect for the Whisky? Aye. (Beyond the spelling!)  
Similar attitudes towards the English? Aye.
Isn't Ireland a lot more right wing economically? They didn't become the "Celtic tiger" with Scandinavian tax rates, and both the government and the opposition are centre right parties.
Aren't the Scots mostly secular Protestants while Irish are strongly Catholic?
As long as the drinks flow & people are up for a few scuffles during closing time, tis all good.
Not sure about how 'strongly' anymore, but it wouldn't be a problem. It's only a problem in the North because whether someone Catholic and Protestant was and easy way to identify 'the other side'

The Union of Craic, has a term for people who dont support their team during a major championship.  The term is dry shite.  Everyone from the Union of Craic knows the term, it is used to refer to people who are lacking in Craic or have no understanding of the concept of Craic.   The Irish, Northern Irish and Scottish often use it to refer to the English.

  I call that supporting your team during a INTERNATIONAL football tournament, and it is hardly blind, we know one of two outcomes will happen for our countries who have qualified, we will either win it or get knocked out.  Lies are largely responsible for the English and Welsh voting to leave. 
[deleted]
I don't think you should support the team if you don't like soccer or whatever. But its hardly blind nationalism to support your national team.   You'd have to be into a team sport to understand it. Most people don't take it too seriously and it's just a bit of fun at the end of the day. No comparison to taking your life for your country. There probably is an extreme element where you could make that argument though.

Your dead right to be bothered by that man.   That sort of fanaticism is not only a bit ridiculous but has caused and will only cause problems in the world.
> ...you might as well be looked upon as scum for not going along with the program. At least, that's my impression of the mentality of a lot of people here during the ongoing tournament craze.   We probably have different social circles but I have not gotten this impression at all. People who like football are enjoying the ride and a lot of people who don't usually care about football are going along with it but it's perfectly fine if you are not into the whole thing, nobody gives a shit.  Then there are those who feel the need to loudly proclaim that they don't care about football, even if nobody asks them. As if not caring about football makes you somehow better than anyone else. Smacks of insecurity really.

Is Ireland bigger than Scotland?  We look awfully thin in comparison
Ireland: approx. 85,000 km^2  Scotland: approx. 78,000 km^2
Huh. Would have always thought Scotland was much bigger. TIL.
Its how you use it that counts
the mirth is in the girth
Population is similarly larger, too.  Ireland: approx. 6.4 million   Scotland: approx. 5.4 million  edit: to be honest, my preference would be for a United Ireland and an independent Scotland to be independent countries in the European Union, with close ties due to cultural bonds.
Don't take this the wrong way but you're far too sensible to live in the The Union of Craic! :P

I love the idea of Scotland and Northern Ireland teaming up and joining the eu together. 
Sad Welshman here peering over the fence 
Before rushing into such an agreement, we'd need to carefully consider the terms and conditions.   Tell us more about the 'pints are on us'.. pints plural? Is it one each or all we can drink? Is there a limit of which brews we can choose? If the weather's nice I quite like a lager tops. Or don't you include cocktails?  Ah fukit, man, we don't mind buying our rounds and maybe we should just get a kitty going for the sesh 
In fairness the proposal has had a little more interest than we were expecting… I think we've the money in the budget, might have to double check with the IMF. However under the terms of the new /r/Celticunion we get the first round in (Guinness, bit early for cocktails) if you lads don't mind sorting out Northern Ireland. I think that should cover everyone… if not we'll send the tab to London, they're minted anyway. 
Can we Aussies join, we might have barely any connection to you two, and we *are* 15,182 ks away from you, but we can give you a place somewhat warmer for you lot to visit, with no passports required, and if need be we can bring the Kiwis.
Oh come on, let London join. They're the good guys, and they have $$$.

Best to get your pounds as quick as you can while they're cheap. No too many though, or you'll bankrupt us.

She really seems as though she's determined enough to keep Scotland in the EU. It's really going to test her ability as a leader, especially when she hasn't been First Minister for very long.  I feel quite optimistic.
Maybe she'll soon be President. 
I'd love to see Scotland adopt a presidential system. I feel like a parliamentary system inevitably leads to a certain disconnect between the public and their representatives, and while presidential systems might have issues with gridlock, I'd prefer an inefficient system to an undemocratic one.
american here, you dont want a presidential system, trust me.  its a nightmare with a legislature controlled by one party and the executive branch by another, the gridlock is mind numbing, they cant even agree to fund the govt at times, one party decided to hold the country hostage b/c the other party refused to overturn a law that was its crowning achievement. parliamentary system is better IMO. 
No need to replicate the shitty US system. Could simply replicate the Irish system. Sturgeon as taoiseach and Salmond as uachtarán. Dream team.
It's not as though the UK's parliamentary system is working out dreadfully well for them right now...I mean, Cameron & Brexit...and Israel's parliamentary system is a total disaster, with religious fundamentalists getting insane concessions because Netanyahu needs them in his coalition. Sure, we Americans might have our problems, but it could be a lot worse.
Cameron and Brexit is the system working, the people got their will, the fact you disagree with them doesn't change that.
Aye but the Torys got a majority in WM on 37% of the vote at tge GE
I'm actually american originally too but live in Edinburgh now. I prefer the presidential system, but there's pros and cons to each.
She can live in the Broon House. 
Not to be too unkind to your point of view (it's a very fair and valid one) but the idea of a Presidential system (and becoming more like America) in Scotland terrifies me.  I think parliamentary systems are much better at representing all points of view, unless the voting system used screws that up, like FPTP does. In Scotland, and Germany for that matter, a more proportional parliament encourages long-term planning and common-sense compromising on issues, rather than theatrical confrontational politics. I think those theatrics are the real reason people are disengaged, not the parliamentary system itself. 
Having an executive and then checks and balances is just a recipe for legislature nightmare and glacial political change. A parliamentary 'first among equals' system is a lot better as long as you have a proper representative voting system. Thankfully, Scotland's already ahead of the rest of the UK on a better voting system.  Also Parliamentary systems encourage coalitions, which means we're less likely to get shitey parties dictating everything on those that didn't vote for them.
Only power a "gtaf". Separation of powers and that. 
what's the difference?
Wait. How about a presidential system with a proportionally representative bicameral parliament and multiparty bipartisan elections? That could work.    
Yeah that's about what I invision. But with single transferable voting for the parliament/senate
NO. We're not invading anything. We're modern Scots, not some random clan of Picts.  
It's late, give me a break.
ok
Not Scottish, but why wouldn't she be prime minister? The Republic of Ireland has a PM. So does NZ/Aus/Canada
A prime minister is not the head of state. In Commonwealth countries like Canada, the Queen is head of state. If Scotland leaves, they will need someone to act as head of state. Generally speaking, you have either a monarch or a President as head of state, and then someone like a prime minister that runs the country. If your country is really powerful, you probably have a different setup where the president is both head of state, and runs the country.     Also, Ireland has no prime minister, they have a President and a Taoiseach. The president is head of state, and the Taoiseach is the head of government.

As someone who has lived in England for a year and now moved back to The Netherlands because of the uncertainty for my future caused by the referendum I have to say, I wish I had moved to Scotland instead.  Be proud of your First Minister, she will go down in history, and truly fights for her people. I for one hope you guys stay in the EU as we could use a politician like her in Brussels. 
Come along, we'll still have you.
I already signed up for a study as I had to do so before May 1st (otherwise I would have waited until after the referendum) but afterwards I would be happy to move to beautiful Scotland.
Well welcome to the Netherlands, I hope you have a great time here! It's not Scotland but it's still a nice enough country.  What university do you go to?

One is a Scottish hero who fought for independence and succeded and the other is Sturgeon so there is a big difference
Looks like i'm in the minority of people not loving the sturge.
I think you have to admire her since the Brexit vote. She looks and acts like the only true leader in the whole UK
Like her or hate her she's the only person on this goddamned landmass who knows what they are doing tomorrow.
Ones from Braveheart, the other is from Rab C Nesbit.
*IF* she manages to keep Scotland in the EU without major changes (fuck adopting the Euro, etc.) then she'll be worthy of these memes/jokes. However, until then, let's hasten the tit-wank over this woman who has done fuck all just yet.
[deleted]
Well, instead of falling about celebrating/bemoaning the outcome like the Westminster mob she did exactly what is expected of a leader and immediately began consultations with parliament and foreign representatives with the intent of finding out what could be done to respect the Scottish people and their choice to remain.  She already has tentative cross party support for her initiative to keep Scotland in both the EU and the UK. Down south it is a shit show with Labour tearing itself apart and the Tories caught up in a leadership race while they should be pursuing supposed British interests.
You need a moment alone?
This level of fawning only occurs when we finally have a politician that isnt a parasite and is working towards exactly what the people want
Shit, is it nap time already?

This is why you shouldn't be allowed on the internet until you're 18.
Really we're comparing her to willy god wtfs happened to this country I can deal with you guys wanting to be in the EU even though I don't agree but comparing this troll to him I used to be patriotic as fuck now I know why theres no point.

There's one in Edinburgh too.  Fun novelty for a couple of visits but it's not really exceptional.
Closed recently, I heard.
A restaurant is the main reason you miss Glasgow?
Sure is.
Did you try Sapporo when you were here?
I didn't. Never tried Japanese food when I lived there, and the gf doesn't like Japanese food, so it's unfortunately out of the question whenever we come back to visit.
Most of the mains aren't really Japanese at all. It's fried rice and meat (easy to do on a teppanyaki grill). They do of course have a lot of sushi too but I'm sure she'd find something she likes. Give it a go next time!
Ooft. Really big chap? It's fucking brutal. 
There is (or was) one in Leith where my cousin worked about 15 years ago. Place was a touch legendary.
Better than a rape joke, I guess.

Well this is an interesting little bot that pulls parts from the other comments in a thread to make it's own comment.
Deliciously salty. 10/10
28 million English, 2 million Scots and 800,000 (Northern) Irish walk into a bar, and along with a few others, left after holding a democratic vote on whether to leave or not.
How many Welsh?
No idea, but more sheep than people :)
1.5 million
I guess "a group of Irish, English and Scottish people walk into a bar, then leave because they operate as a democracy and the majority want to" doesn't have the same ring to it 
Well your version of the joke makes no sense: for starters, you'd have to explain why the Englishman's vote is weighted 10 times as much as the others.  I'm not sure I'd laugh at that at all.
A group of Irish, English and Scottish people walk into a bar. There are 10 times more English people than there are Irish and Scottish. They then leave because they operate as a democracy and the majority want to.
>They then leave because they operate as a flawed democracy and the majority of English forced them to.  Fixed that for you.
How do you reckon a democracy is flawed because it didn't follow the whim of a minority?
62% voted remain, yet Scotland is being forced to leave. Two out of three nations (Wales is a principality of England) in the union voted to remain yet are being forced to leave.  Seems like the minority are the ones dictating how things should be.  Scotland should probably seek independence as it is rapidly becoming clear that the English and Scots electorate do not share similar views. The English are insular, xenophobic and conservative. The Scots are socialist, inclusive, and pro-immigration.
I mean, most Scots and most English people. There were remain votes in England and leave voters in Scotland.
>62% voted remain, yet Scotland is being forced to leave.  Because it wasn't a Scottish vote but a British one.  >Two out of three nations (Wales is a principality of England) in the union voted to remain yet are being forced to leave.  Not only would Wales being a principality not disqualify it from being a nation, but it is a *constituent country* in exactly the same way that Scotland is. But aye, yer a country an they're no, because Mel Gibson.  There is however one part of the UK that is often not considered a country: Northern Ireland. That would bring the country count to 2 Leave: 1 Remain. And that's even granting that internal boundaries matter in a nationwide vote, which they don't.  >The English are insular, xenophobic and conservative. The Scots are socialist, inclusive, and pro-immigration.  You have the political understanding of David Coburn and the dismissive generalising talent of Donald Trump.
53 million people out of 63 million is not a minority my son. And how are you gonna score northern Ireland as 1 but not even count Wales? I'll give them both half so now we're back to even   Edit: ps Scotland can leave is they want that's up to them
Ur a funy guy
Ooo! Ooo! I know! Change this part: >They then leave because they operate as a democracy and the majority want to.  To  >The Scots and the Irish want to stay but the English forcibly drag them out kicking and screaming.
Probably because there's 10 of them for each Scot and each Irishman 
Well that makes perfect sense. If you put it in the buildup...   Still not funny though ;)
Left the Welsh guy behind too, so all of 'em are dicks.

when did the Irish vote to join?
Norn Iron did, sortof. They were granted special autonomy within the Irish republic, which included the privilege of being able to vote to rejoin the UK at any time, which they immediately did.
There was actually a vote as far as I remember but I don't recall it being a full plebiscite. Having looked it up again it seemed they were represented by the new parliament of Northern Ireland created in 1920.  In any case it was obvious for a long time where the allegiance of the bulk of the North lay to differing degrees of fervent belief. It's really quite sad to the point it's almost funny of how myopic everyone from Parnell to Gladstone and beyond thought the North would just get used to the idea of home rule in line with the rest of Ireland. No one really understood just how entrenched attitudes were until everyone was already armed to the teeth. It's the saddest tale the British Isles has ever known.
Scot*
Scott who? Missing some pertinent info here.
That aint the fucking Glasgow Mongolian Consulate, its the Mongolian kebabery.  That's basically saying kebab house is a Turkish consulate.  Which is a lump of shit.
Fuck sake mate you must have won lots of awards in primary school for the goodness of your smartery.   Mind that time there were hings called jokes?
*Whoosh!*
Don't you all think this might be taking the disappointment from Saturday a bit to far.... it's just a game after all 
Fuck Rugby... Were a tennis country anyway....
5th in the world for Rugby Union is pretty good
that's because 90% of the world doesn't play it
Englishman here, that's pretty much the only way we can ever be good at a sport. Usually one we invented as well. Rugby and Cricket were sports invented by the English and mostly played by former colonies who have now beaten us at our own game. It's not quite American levels of bad (Baseball "World Series" anyone?) but it's not far off
well for Scotland it's football and golf and we're shite at both
American here, let us know when anyone can consistently beat us at basketball and we'll chat
Fair comment, although I think you may have misunderstood my comment. I wasn't saying that the USA is bad at the sports they invented, just that no one else plays the damn things. With the exception of the Olympics etc. there's no "World Cup" of Baseball, Basketball, American Football etc., it's just American teams against other American teams.      So when someone says "the only reason Scotland are in the top tier of Rugby is because no one else plays it", my mind goes to America and their "World" championships basically being national championships. 
No other people play them, it's just that we're super annoying about the names we use for our sports championships and elitist about who we let play in them, mostly for franchising reasons. Good point though, cheers. 
>I wasn't saying that the USA is bad at the sports they invented, just that no one else plays the damn things. With the exception of the Olympics etc. there's no "World Cup" of Baseball,  :| We're right in the middle of the 2017 [World Baseball Classic](https://www.worldbaseballclassic.com/). There were two games played today: the Dutch beat the Israelis 12-2, and Venezuela and Italy will play each other in about seven hours in a tie-breaker game to determine who moves on to the eight-team championship round.  >Basketball,  FIBA World Cup  >American Football etc.  IFAF World Championship (which is admittedly a fairly fringe event that few people are aware of nor care about)  Just because Britons don't play any of these sports at a high level it does not mean "no one else plays them".
No world cup of Basketball? You're just jealous of all our FIBA world cups
I think pointing at the Olympics would suffice.  That covers a wide range of sports and competitions where America does quite well. 
Andy Murray will finally permanently Scottish, not just when he doesn't win. 
*BRITISH TENNIS PLAYER ANDY MURRAY WINS WIMBLEDON*  *SCOTTISH TENNIS PLAYER ANDY MURRAY DEFEATED IN LIFE THREATENING TENNIS TOURNAMENT*

No unfortunately your successes will still be called British, Irish celebs are often called British in the English press when they win awards, and we've been independent for almost a century.

Good lad, welcome aboard.

Good choice! All we need now is another few hundred thousand and it's in the bag.  onwards and upwards.
Do you think an independent Scotland would be more or less likely to face austerity? duh duh duh
interesting how no one has brought up perhaps one of the most important characters in this new referendum...  Big Donnie Trump. he willnae be able to keep his mouth shut and could swing it for the yes campaign
It will be interesting to see Cheeto Benito's thoughts on the matter, since he is a Scottish descendant.

Trumpelthinskin. There, you can have that.

Mango Mussolini?
Giant Wotsit.
> Cheeto Benito's  Are you referring to Dorito Mussolini? 
Mango Mussolini's got my vote.
Last time we got told that his mom was a very smart lady who loved the queen and would have voted No.  not sure whether that endorsement repeated will play well or not.
He'd probably suggest that Scotland should become the 51st American state.
We can nationalise his Scottish golf course.  Or encircle it with windmills.
If we have to consult *every* local hotel owner, we'll never get anywhere.
Donald trump swinging the yes campaign? He's a populist, he also changes his views like his drawers, I think he'll come out in favour of the yes campaign, but Scotland fucking despises the man.   In fact, I think him wagging his idiot tongue about this would help the no vote because of how reviled he is. 
Trump is anti-independence so he would back the no campaign and could swing it for the yes campaign.
Oh god, yes please. A selfish yank billionaire throwing money around to get his way. It would do wonders for the yes-movement if he came out for no. :)
What if he comes out in favour of yes?
'Murican here - Donnie Boy won't do that. He has too much money in Scotland to want Scotland to have a more progressive economy.
Yeah but he's mental. May might look at him the wrong way or something then suddenly Trump'll be a massive Scottish independence fan.
Not with Nicola Sturgeon as FM. He hates her and the SNP after the SNP helped put a windfarm next to his golf course.
Not impossible, but Donnie Boy's lunacy seems to encompass profiteering off of government as much as possible, and IndyRef passing will probably be bad for his bottom line, so...  Ultimately, though, it seems more likely that Kushner and Bannon will make the call on this, and both are likely to back the UK remaining whole as it will undermine the EU, and they *hate* the EU.
He hates the SNP with a passion.
If Trump says something it will be the end of the yes vote.
jesus, we had this for a year during the primaries and then about another 6 months during the election but in the end Trump won
What a beamer if we vote no again 
I'll be honest, I'm sporting a raging fear stonner. I don't think I could take 3 such hefty consecutive boots to the baws, constitutionally speaking, but at the same time, if it finally happens, I'll be aww like "Yyyyyaaaaassss!!!!"
**"Raging Fear Stonner"**  Remind me, was that the film with Steven Seagal or Liam Neeson? 
Liam Neeson and Robert De Niro I think.
Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen TBH 
Why's that?
Just a feeling I have. I don't think the tide has changed enough from those who voted no before to secure a yes win. I don't think the EU issue will change enough minds 
I'm not sure. I'm in Glasgow which was a more 'yes' region. But most people I have met have been very staunch no. I have an English accent so I think most assume I'm 'no' as well... the agression I've seen from many is astounding. A vehement hatred for the SNP and sturgeon. A disgust towards anyone who would support yes. It's genuinely taken me aback.  Their minds will likely never change, but how much of the population do they make up? I think the tendancy for most of the 'undecided' is to go with the seemingly more stable option of business as is with the UK. But now the UK doesn't seem so sweet. The politics is mired with factionalism. Is it's getting bat shot insane to the point where everyone seems to accept there is no common good and just want to fight their corner because that is their category.   I think 'yes' has a very strong narrative coming in and the 'no' argument has lost some of its 'common sense' image.
As a side note from what you said, I've never understood when people get violent about politics. I can understand getting angry about certain results, but no one deserves to be threatened or hurt because of a political decision they made. The majority of people are doing what they think is best for their country or their family and the majority of people don't have a fucking clue what will happen.   YES voters generally think that an independent Scotland will prosper, whereas NO voters generally think that the strength of the UK provides peace of mind. Neither deserve violence from the other side
Sadly to some extent it has worked. In 2014 I was proud of my 'Yes' posters. Now that I live with my girlfriend and any window smashing or neds etc could have an effect on her life I have to keep my head lower.  I'd also be less inclined to go out and volunteer knowing how militant some people are about this, though I'm wrestling with that a bit because I don't want it to work.  Asides from the threats and the names and everything else I've heard, you get depressingly funny stuff - people not drinking Guinness out of principle, refusing to sit on green chairs, getting their kids to say 'shite' when someone says 'green'. I don't think that would surprise many up Scotland and I know it wouldn't anyone from Glasgow.  I don't give a flying fuck about sport ball personally but it's all tied up and there's a very dedicated, passionate and militant extreme tied up with football and politics. Though other than that and so long as I keep to myself they are always normally very nice on a personal level. But the notions of tradition and loyalty lie at the core of their being and frankly I feel nothing will ever sway them from how they have reconciled those concepts with the British establishment and their community.   
> I've never understood when people get violent about politics  Violence and politics went hand to hand since ancient times. It is pretty much a modern phenomena for little to no violence is occurring in politics in most of the world.
I know! And I don't understand it. I didn't say in my previous comment that it didn't occur in the past
It's in human tribal nature, really.  When something that feels like a threat to you and your group of people, you get physical to intimidate or eliminate that threat.
I know someone very much like that, to the point where I can't share my views as it Is just not worth it. I'd probably be ex-communicated. The hatred is too deep.  Unfortunately a few people in Scotland base their politics on historical football rivalry and defend it until the death, without actually gathering information on the subject and making their own independent and informed decision.   On both sides, I'd hasten to add.
As I understand it Scotland wouldn't be able to join the EU; Spain would veto.  Edit: Interesting replies, I suppose only time will tell.
It's started again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYIMvEvmwSs
http://wingsoverscotland.com/thats-that-one-sorted-then/  Good video there showing that may not be in the case. I'm actually pretty sceptical of the EU ( think it achieves very little of what it's lauded for and comes at a heavy price). But I have very little doubt Scotland will be allowed in. A lot of countries are euro sceptics and one of its biggest members just left. They would absolutely love to have a story of a country that liked the EU so much that it left the union of Great Britain to be a part of it. Any country which tried to stop this from happening would be playing a dangerous game.
Triggered
[Referendum Triggering Intensifies]
full riddy
Would the SNP have to abandon their current stance on independence in such an eventuality?
They'd probably stick with it, but wouldn't be able to call a third indyref any time soon.  It sure would be weird if we kept voting No but kept voting SNP
That hasn't stopped Quebec from voting Bloc Quebecois.
Parti Quebecois* would be more appropriate, Bloc Quebecois is a federal party representing Quebec interests on the canadian scene. (source, I'm a Quebecer)
The Parti Québécois (PQ) is a sovereignist provincial political party in Quebec in Canada. The PQ advocates national sovereignty for Quebec involving independence of the province of Quebec from Canada and establishing a sovereign state, members are known as Péquistes  The Bloc Québécois (BQ)  is a federal political party in Canada devoted to Quebec nationalism and the promotion of Quebec sovereignty, members are known as "Bloquistes".  The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Québécois, the provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence, but the two are not linked organizationally  Both parties representing Quebec's politicians personal pecuniary interests on the Canadian scene. (source, Generations off and on Quebec's).  Sorry for being cynical, I rather interpret their actions than believe in politicians words.
And also, it should be noted, both parties got pretty slammed the last few elections.
Not both parties.  Bloc Quebecois definitely got hammered but Parti Quebecois is still the main opposition in the provincial parliament.  However, I must say that Parti Quebecois is getting less relevant with time, younger people (pro-independence) don't really recognize themselves in this party and prefer voting for Quebec Solidaire, a leftist and indepententist party.  Parti Quebecois incarnate the older vision of independence in Quebec: protect the French language, our heritage, our symbols, etc. That whole identity rhetoric is not really popular for the younger indepententists, they want a sovereign Quebec more inclusive.
That's true, and the souverainistes I did meet who were my age (under 30) were not into the PQ.  Fair point, I think of the PQ as having taken a beating going from majority to second-place to a liberal majority but maybe that's because I'm not that tuned into QC politics (I only lived there about five years and always felt disenchanted by QC politics) and think of it as a two-party PQ/Liberal province provincially, but then Avenir is a decent size too IIRC.  I seem to like living in places that wanna be independent ;-)
People have stopped voting BQ although other have pointed out the PQ - BQ thing.
Yeah but Canada actually undergone reforms after the vote from what a recall. UK parliament has done feck all.
This is exactly what will happen. We are a confusing country haha.
Country? 
Yeah, what else would we be?
I'll tell you once Nicola asks permission from the UK if Scotland can be a country or not. 
Only in the most pedantic and literal tear down of the word are the constituent members of the UK not countries.
Scotland is a component of the UK. Just like New Jersey is a component of the USA.   New Jersey though has more autonomy. Scotland is called a country out of habit and *feeling*, it has nothing to do with actual evidence or power.   I'm pro-Indy by the way. I want Scotland to become a country. Not a "semi-sortof-kinda-region-when-it-suits...but we're a country when it comes to the fitba" type thing. 
The UK is not comprised of federal regions. The UN definition of 'country' includes non-sovereign states that constitute one part of a greater union.
Not necessarily, perhaps the Scots in general want to be in the UK, but under a much less constricted framework, perhaps with complete freedom to handle internal affairs.
Who else do Scots vote for?
There used to be this party called Labour but now I'm not sure where it went...
There are plenty of people who vote SNP because of their good social policies but don't want independence. These policies would be unsustainable if independent. 
> but wouldn't be able to call a third indyref any time soon  Why? Generations are only a few years, people will soon forget.
they grow up so fast...
Well of course they'd be able to tender a motion, but I doubt there'd be public or parliamentary support for IndyRef3 in 2022 if 1 and 2 were both No (Unless circumstances had significantly changed again)
Its the reason the SNP exist in the first place.  It would be like the Tories stopping fucking poor people and giving tax breaks to the rich.
Nah, they would just carry on crying foul and pushing for another one.  That is why I switched to supporting independence, it takes up too much political time and energy in the rUK which isn't fair.
Just looking at Quebec yeah the second time takes it out of a referendum movement 
I wouldn't worry too much. There will always another excuse. 
Honestly if that happens I'll be disgusted. I'm saying this as a unionist. So narrow minded by the nationalists. Wanting a referendum so soon after the last one. It astounds me how self righteous they are
your calling the scottish electorate self righteous, that just makes you even more self righteous,  the people returned the mandate when we voted the SNP back into power get over it
How many times does it need to be said?   There are plenty of people who are not for independence but like the SNP's policies so they will vote for them. 
Then they should read the damn SNP manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections. The SNP have an ironclad mandate for this. 
people don't read the small print that's their problem
But unfortunately, that gives the SNP a mandate for their whole manifesto, not just the bits those voters liked.  They are perfectly free to vote No in the referendum, but they cannot be upset that their vote allowed the SNP to uphold a pledge they knew about
Perhaps these people believed that the SNP would actually hold true to their word and wait a generation before calling for another referendum instead of 4 fucking years. 
Well, those people clearly didn't read the manifesto they were voting for, seeing as it clearly stated that they would seek a second referendum if there was a material change and actually specified as such Britain voting to leave the EU.  They don't have my sympathy
You hold the intellect of the electorate in such low regard. Not only was it in the SNP's manifesto, it was all over the news for months before the Scottish elections that the SNP would call for another referendum if Brexit happened against our will. The SNP and Greens were elected in the full knowledge this would happen.
Nicola has played her hand well in framing Indyref2 as a referendum on the Brexit deal, while Theresa May and David Davis work tirelessly to deny anyone outside of HM Government (including HM Parliament) a meaningful vote on it. Scottish Government appears democratic, HM Government autocratic. May and Davis are backed into a corner here. They either have to back down and make the process more democratic (which is of significant political and practical difficulty) or compromise on Scotland's desire for a more Federal approach (which presents similar but different challenges) in order to fend off this line of attack. As it is, I suspect they're going to have to let it play out, come what may.
>As it is, I suspect they're going to have to let it play out, come what may.  So to speak.
No pun intended™

Same to yoursel's now too! 
And from the English! Hope you finally stop whinging and fuck off already
No no no if it won't piss the English off then what's the point of independence?
Love you too babes x
There might be mixed feelings about immigration in Sweden, but we are united in that Scotland would be a welcome addition to the Nordic countries.
I can only hope this leads to an independent Scotland holding its own Melodifestivalen.
If it's an excuse to get pissed we'll take it
Scotland everybody! Ah...I love this place
If you like Eurovision, you'll like this. Otherwise it's good for a piss up. So... win-win?
One needs to be horizontal in the gutter to be able to enjoy that :)
Ahh good, a Scotsman's natural state
Staring at the stars.
We may be down here puking on ourselves in the gutter, but we're looking up at the stars, haha 
As a nordic country you don't need an excuse to be pissed.
I can say the same on behalf of Denmark as well I think.
but what about the most nordic of countries, Estonia?
no eesti must stay with baltic 
Estie can't into
Would be nice of them to turn up.
Same for Iceland
I don't think Scotland can be Nordic. We're not Vikings, we don't speak Norse, we're much closer to Ireland and England culturally than we ever will be to the Scandinavian countries or the other Nordic nations.  But we do share some similarities, and I'm sure an independent Scotland would apply to become an observer on the Nordic Council at the earliest opportunity, and find some friends there.
As a ginger man with long hair and a beard, I'm fairly sure that the population of Scotland and Ireland have significant amount Viking blood in them.   The problem would possibly be approaching how it ended up there in a sensitive fashion.  All said I'd be very happy to be part of the Nordic block.
With the history n that i reckon we do have a decent bit o viking.   But red hair wise, ive read that scotland and ireland had red hair long before the vikings arrived
It's a celtic thing. It's just a weird lie that people like to push.
That's a myth. Red heads in Scandinavia mostly came about because of slavery. Scotland was ravaged for slaves like Europe did to Africa. Fuckme, people are stupid as fuck.
So you're arguing that Red Heads came FROM Scotland to Scandinavia because of Slavery?   Either way I fail to see how that argues against cross-pollination unless your views on historical slavery are a lot more happy-happy than mine. 
> We're not Vikings  Well I mean the Vikings did impregnate most of your ancestors, so *technically*...
They also killed everyone on a few of our islands :)
:)
I think I might be.  Source: I have a sword and am oiling it right now.
Thats not a sword you pervert.
Where are you from?! Lowlander Sassenach? Have a look where a number of Highland words/names come from. Scandinavian links are prominent.
You do realise English and Scandinavians are very much from the same stock? Germanic people.
I know that we are a superior hybrid, yes.
There's Scandinavian links, but to think we're "more" Scandinavian than the English is mind-boggling absurd. Especially as half the Anglo-Saxons *were actually from fucking Scandinavia*.
And Normans were Vikings too, although they spent a couple of generations in France, picking up the language after taking Normandy from the French king. :)
Sure, there's certainly been contact with them. Scotland is hardly a second Denmark, though.
> Scotland is hardly a second Denmark, though.  That was England ;)  We were too busy fighting the Norwegians for some islands....I think
Actually we are pretty close to vikings. If you're Scottish there's a very high chance you can trace your DNA back to some Viking rape. 
> we don't speak Norse,   Tbf, only Iceland can make that claim. Besides, some of Scots has shared words...or at least roots with Nordic languages.
Lots of Scots words are closer to Norwegian than to English. https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/41v38c/the_similarity_between_scottish_and_scandinavian/ Caution source = reddit!
Who cares about what you were, in todays World, being Nordic means something else.    All Scotland needs is some more wintersporters, a slight rethinking of the cuisine and 45° turn of the flag and we wouldn't even be able to tell the difference.
I'm from Shetland so pretty much Norwegian anyway. Let's join the Nords. 
Do we have to change the flag? The Saltire counts as a cross right?
Yeah, we might just need to move it to left a bit to match the flag standard
Awwww......  Fine, if it means it's easier to come over
What's the advantage to being descirbed as nordic? I don't get people's obession with Scotland becoming nordic.
People on reddit will queuing up to suck us off
they will bow to our will.  Muhahhahaha
Reddit's obsession with Scottish nationalism is ridiculous. After the referendum there were so many yanks giving condolence to Scots because they saw the no vote as 'the wrong choice'. They assume most of us are brave crusaders of freedom who are sick of being kept down by Le oppressive English. 
Kind of, although I think a lot of yanks also were big fans of the social policies that were bound up with the nationalism movement and were rooting for another English-speaking country to have a go at them.  I'll probably also be rooting for Indy Ref 2.0 as I think it could help provide some momentum toward preserving the EU (which is one of the most important geopolitical developments of the last two centuries) and also because it is a big fuck off to Trump/Bannon/Farage's broader political goal to break the world into smaller racist quasi-fascist independent states (which will lead back to the kind of wars that we saw in the first half of the 20th century).  As yanks, we have nothing more than a rooting interest, but I promise to devote my families tourism dollars to another trip out if things go well.
i know then they go and do somethiing stupid and vote Donald fucking Trump as their presidant
No direct experience in Scotland. But my personal experience is do not pay as much attention to politicians words as to their actions.  Most independence movements originally were beneficial for many reasons, nowadays many seem motivated by politicians pecuniary self interests.
The SNP are a centralist party,  One of two things could happen afrer indy.  It bolsters the SNP because it suits people to have a cental line or the SNP will split into left and right parties which gives the Scottish electorate more choice who to vote for and given we will use PR that is a good thing
Scottish independence is quickly becoming to the left what Brexit was to the scared and confused alt-right wannabes. 
what a fucking garbage comment
Anything to back that up?
They already are tbh
I think it's more to do with having the characteristics of a Nordic country -- independent, generally social democratic etc. 
But we can do all that without being described as Nordic. I just don't really get it. 
Maybe there's just a higher degree of prestige in having a seat on the Norwich Council.   edit: Fuck Norwich.  edit 2: You know what? I endorse pedestrianisation.
I'm dead against the pedestrianisation of Scotland. Traders need access to Dixon's.  
gonna be hard, they'll need to go to Comet instead.......oh wait
Well I don't know anybody who is going to vote Yes for the sole reason of being described as a 'Nordic' country. As I said, I think people want to describe Scotland as a 'Nordic' country because the Nordic countries are themselves proof of relatively small, independent nations who are doing just fine (they're also some of our closest neighbours in the North-West of Europe geographically). They are a kind of model many people would like Scotland to replicate.
And the exact model that the conservatives are saying doesn't work as they sell the NHS.
More than just fine, they're kicking the shit out of the US in many areas. And hey, Scotland's got a lot of Nordic roots. 
It gives people a warm fuzzy feeling inside when they think about it.
their is a lot of socially poor people who are getting cut from disability benefits that would disagree
Sorry i don't get what you mean? Only nordic countries don't cut disability benefit?
the tories are not socially democratic, they are anti poor - pro rich is what my point is and the prospect of anther 15 years of it is too much for Scotland to bear
Ok. I was talking about being 'noridic' not independent.
yes i have realised i have read your comment wrong, sorry
What a load of bullshit man.
What's a load of bullshit?
Sorry you were speaking on a political level so I take back my comment, which I judged by lumping it with the other comments here. The idea that Scotland is somehow genetically close to Scandinavia or culturally, when in fact it's one of the least in West and Northern Europe.
Poor Eesti. Cockblocked again
It's not all positives though.  Taggart is grim enough without them all standing on greyscale beaches while staring into the middle-distance.

Oh christ, scandi-noir set in Glasgow would be so depressing. Would it even count? Is one of the points of it that it's sad and bleak things happening in beautiful environments?

What has Scotland got to do with the Nordic countries? It's one of the least Germanic countries in Western Europe.
The dialects from many east coast areas are heavily influenced by Danish or Norwegian, so there's that
You mean like practically the whole of Northern England? Lancashire and Yorkshire and Geordie accents are practically old viking accents slowly changing. Manchester and Liverpool changed dramatically because of Irish immigration.
Yeah, and like the Borders, Fife, Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland. And, much of those dialects have migrated across Scotland.
Borders dialect isn't as much of a big thing now, there's been far too many people move in from other areas especially Glasgow.  But what I mean is Scottish accent may have been influenced by it, Lancashire and Yorkshire accents are full on.
>Borders dialect isn't as much of a big thing now  Fuck off, it totally is. I'm from there, and it is definitely still a thing! I've lived in different places across Scotland but most of my family have remained there, and I struggle to understand them when I go home, even though I grew up there.  As for Lankashire and Yorkshire, I can't really speak for them, but that doesn't take anything away from my initial point that many Scottish dialects are heavily influenced by Nordic countries, so we have that in common with them.
The borders accent to me I hear mostly in older people, not much older, like 50's and above. Feels like younger people just have a kind of toned down Scottish accent. It's definitely different.
It's definitely different, but it is still one of the strongest dialects I have ever come across. Plus, every single one of my friends from outside the Borders (even as close as Edinburgh) struggle to understand the young people there.
That's weird, I guess I can't hear it because I've been here so long.
Scotland isn't, wasn't and never will be a Nordic nation. I don't get why people on /r/Scotland are so eager to pick up this foreign internationalist identity while trying to entirely disavow the historically legitimate British identity.
Have you never watched Vikings? They're cool as fuck. 
It's more about adopting the [Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model), and having more in common with the Nordic nations as a result, for trade and the like. 
Once again, pursuing social and political ideals rather than cultural or racial ones. 
It isn;t more about that. People genuinely think we are more Nordic than England, which 1 minute of research could debunk.
>People genuinely think we are more Nordic than England  Can you link to an example?
It seems to be a lot of people on this subreddit think. It's ridiculous, the only places that can claim it are the islands which makes sense. The vikings didn't want Scotland, so they took the islands and used it as a base to capture slaves. What did you want a source on?
> It seems to be a lot of people on this subreddit think.  Can you link to an example?
> Scotland isn't, wasn't  Er, might wanna brush up on your history books 
It would first require you to brush up your comment to make sense
Scotland was, or at least a large chunk of it, Nordic at one point. 
>Scotland isn't, wasn't and never will be **a Nordic nation**.
British identity isnt anything to be proud of, it just makes me think of bleak rainy days, horrible accents, depressing daytime television and stale cigarette smoke.  
Can Ireland into Nordic? 
> There might be mixed feelings about immigration in Sweden  Is there really? Who is still on board with that disaster besides the news or anyone who stands to profit from immigration while being well-protected from any ills it brings?

Aye same, don't give a fuck about us.
Can we all just vote Yes this time please?
no 
No, I, like most others like to have my own opinion rather than having it dictated to me due to some people's selfish idea of 'freedom'. 
Freedom is a selfish notion? Desire for self-governance an evil to be stamped out? A future apart from a country in a right-wing death spiral unthinkable? All hands must go down with the ship!
'freedom' for the sake of it is selfish when attaining such a thing makes the country worse for its people. 
"for the sake of it" is either misinformed or obtuse. The aspiration to obtain the freedoms of independence is the ability to chart our own course socio-economically. I'm sorry if you find that selfish. I find it selfish to give no consideration to the voice of a country of this union....and no less of a sham to buy it's continued compliance as a member of this union on promises that were both untrue and unfulfilled.
Seriously arguing that perpetual conservative governments are a good thing for Scotland? Which rock have you been living under? Have you not seen the state of the UK due to their failed policy of austerity?
Full employment, increased growth expectations, overall budget deficit diminishing. You realise an independent Scotland would need to cut everything hard, like more hard than the 2010 government did to get into the EU right because Scotland is running an absolutely huge deficit propped up by the "evil" Conservatives 
Full employment is not a good thing when working poverty has skyrocketed due to zero hour contracts. Increased growth expectations - wages haven't increased in real terms in something like a decade. Running a deficit? During times of capitalist financial crisis's it is important to invest. Have a look at Keynesian economics. Basically it is hard to say what things will look like post-independence because things will so drastically change, the same as they will post-Brexit. 
Brexit.
The other replies have covered it for me, but how can wishing to have self-governance a 'selfish' trait? If the Brexit shitshow isn't the evidence you need that Scotland's interests aren't represented in the union, then that is a special level of burying your head in the sand and I don't know what to tell you. Not to mention the same reasons the anti-independence crowd are using to downplay a Yes result, are largely the same reasons used for Brexit. The hypocrisy is mind-boggling.
[deleted]
I'll be voting yes this time. I'm ashamed of myself that I bought into the better together crap.
Nothing to be ashamed of, we each did what we thought was best at the time. Good to have you onboard though. Must admit I have to find a way to do more this time than just tick the yes box, not easy in North East small community though.
Same, I want to be more involved this time than just turning up at the polling station and watching the news about it.
If more people think like you, we will win scotref easy. :)
Good lad. I hope many more people see through the utter shite that is Project Fear this time around.
i'll be voting no again.
There is still time for major revelations to come. I'm not deciding just yet. I voted yes last time 
Well, looks like that's all the bases covered. 
All we need is a previous no voter not decided this time round
Reporting for duty, Sir!
At least hear the arguments this time. No?
> No?  Yes, that is what he is voting.
I know the arguments. I've listened to them for the last 7 years. 
I won't be voting at all
Honest question, may I ask why?   What were your reasons for voting no the first time? Has there been a change in any of the reasons as to why you're voting no? Thanks
I feel British. Went to school with lots of people from all over Britain and don't want to lose that part of my identity. I also think iScotland would swing heavily to the left and that would be a disaster. Finally I really can't be bothered with it. I'm 23 years old, there's too much uncertainty with separating a country that I really don't want. 
We will still be part of the British isles and likely retain British citizenship.
Even if we retain British citizenship, why would I actually want to leave one of the best countries in the world?
> why would I actually want to leave one of the best countries in the world?  As a disabled man, I could give you lots of reasons as to why I think its not, but your circumstances are different I guess.
Thanks for the response! I'm not Scottish and wanted to learn more about the indyref.
At least hear the arguments this time. Huh?
Whether independence is the right choice or nae, this country is going to become properly divided for the next 5 years or so, whichever side wins will lord it over the other side rather than try working together to make either scenario work.
As if that hasn't already been the case since 2014? There is a lot of "We already had a vote, you lost" been going on. 
There's a good reason for that though, every sensible person accepts that the SNP has had their chance and that they need to wait until they can go for independence again.   The referendum was directly representative of our interests as a whole. You can't just hold them so close together until you get what you want.   It's different to a GE where the voting system is different and the results define how the country is run until the next election which we know will be several years after. There is reason to speak up in governmental elections if you lost, after a referendum, the losing side needs to accept defeat gracefully. 
This argument would hold a lot more weight if Brexit hadn't happened.
Absolutely. I didn't expect it to be called perhaps in my lifetime if Brexit hadn't happened.
How so? 
I voted no (as I *know* some others did as well), based on the talk from the No campaign, that it was the only way to remain in Europe, to not increase the number of borders we have, to retain the status quo, and to not endanger my future at a critical time for me and my partner (we were buying a house and saving to get married).  Brexit has kicked all of those reasons right into the gutter. I'm eager to vote Yes next time.
Because circumstances have massively changed since the last vote, and several promises made by the no campaign haven't been upheld.
My ma voted no to retain EU citizenship. She is now voting yes.
> every sensible person   So 48% of the country is not "sensible" by latest polls. Duly noted. 
If those people can't accept that the SNP had their chance then yes, they are not being sensible. 
Honest question, why do you unionists constantly try to frame the pro-independence movement as an SNP only deal? You all know damn well that there were plenty of groups involved, including two of the five main political parties in Scotland, and (admittedly small) splinter groups from two of the others.
You mean the greens? They're a bunch of naive idealists who are a complete joke of a party. 
Nope, the Independence movement is representative of a wide spectrum of society - those from main political parties and those from none.   Equating the movement solely with the SNP is a very old political dodge. It enables the mainstream media to concentrate it's attack on one party - and more specifically in one person, that party's leader. We saw this with Salmond - and we are seeing it now with Sturgeon.
And Tories are snivelling economically illiterate wee cunts. Both sides can play that game. Do you want to?
>economically illiterate  I'm sorry, who cleaned up the mess that was the financial crisis?
Can you define cleaned up?   From where I'm standing, everything's still fucked. 
You realise this isn't a court of law right? There is no stipulation that there can only be 1 vote for something. Especially in the case of extreme changes.   On top of that, the SNP were voted into power with a campaign promise to provide exactly this in the case of Brexit. You can complain that you are being given a voice on the future of the country but surely you cannot be surprised, or disagree that such a thing should happen.
>  every sensible person  Lost all credibility to your argument right there.  Can we debate this one without veiled insults please?  Not just you, appealing to the general tone of the debate here. 
It's already happening with Brexit. A shite state of affairs all round. 
Yeah, that's why it wont go away any time soon. It has a lot of support, not enough support to Win I dont think, but there is a large portion of the population who support it.   Whenever these conversations come up there is just so much vitriol and No means No and just plain abuse about the SNP and the Indy movement. Nothing is being done to convince the Yes side to change their opinions and vice versa. So this bickering will not go away any time soon. 
It'll be interesting to see what Brexit factors into it. I'd say that will likely be the deciding factor. The way that Scotland's been treated by Parliament and the Tory government has likely made a lot of people more willing to consider Independence. The polls still show it an equal split, but I'd guess that the current state of Parliament would make considerations at least a little more likely. 
I know looking at comments on facebook articles is a direct path to forming a stomach ulcer. But genuinely the only people I see spouting venom are brexiteers/No voters. I feel like they're painting pro-indys as the bad guys when actually the majority of people wanting independence are being quite reasonable about the whole thing. 
My favourite thing to come out of the No Camp during indyref was this video.   Basically saying "you're too thick to think for yourself so just vote no and make a cup of tea".   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLAewTVmkAU
Oh my god I forgot all about this. I've never seen anything more condecending I'd be raging if that video was aimed at me!
Isn't the country already divided if independence votes hang a few percent either side of 50%?
Yep, we can confidently look forward to a nice, clear, decisive result like the Brexit one I suspect...
That's inevitable, across the whole UK. The first Indy Ref left scars in Scotland and Brexit has left gaping wounds in the UK as a whole. Absent the Tories being willing to compromise and take a federal approach (Fat chance - current system affords them effectively absolute power), we're just a freight train barrelling towards a lost decade of bitterness and squabbling. All we can do is play the best game for ourselves individually with the hands we've been dealt. This era will pass. But it's going to get worse before it gets better.
I am glad that you see this, but that also means you need to try to prevent that.
GET IN.
Right Scotland.  If you do support indpendence please get up off you arses and actually vote this time (i know loads who never even bothered)
I'm betting turnout will be substantially lower for a 2nd referendum, I think it's impossible to get the whole country energised for a 2nd time in only 5 years. 
We'll jist hae tae see which way th' russian hackers sway it.
What is most important now is HMG's response. This firmly places the ball in their court.  We may see Scotland get our opt outs even yet. But the hour is late, perhaps too late.
It becomes an interesting 3-way negotiation for sure. Can see the referendum going No and the Tories settling for softer Brexit.
Settling for softer Brexit? That's going off the idea that the EU members aren't furious with us already and actually want us to pack up our shit and leave. Soft Brexit benefits us more than hard Brexit, we just have less overall control over our economy. 
Me too, but that's OK, it would be a compromise to what Scotland actually voted for.
I can see them saying they'll do that and then ignoring us as noone here votes for them.
It wouldn't be us they'd be saying it to, it would be the EU. I say "3-way negotiation" but it's more like the same 2-way one, with the EU strategically leaking information that helps independence, so the Tories have to aim for a softer Brexit.
Surely we need to wait until the brexit negotiations are finished, otherwise it's going to be tough to make an informed decision 
She says by next autumn we should know which way the negotiations are going, so it will be possible to make a decision at that time, 
True, I just feel it would've been better to wait for a calmer time before holding it
Once article 50 is invoked are we able to approach other EU nations for an official stance on Scottish indy and how a request to stay in the EU would work? Surely it would make sense for us to try to get that while we are all still EU citizens?
Probably not formally at least. We'll have to rely on the wonderful interpretation of EU law by every man, woman and dug. There's something that the EU have been saying previously that they will not comment on the internal constitutional matters of member states or something like that. Until we are no longer members (i.e. 2 years after the invocation of article 50) I suspect that flannel will hold.
Won't matter, Scotland will still need to go through the full process 
I think we will too but I'm hoping that we can actually get some kind of timeline and procedural information together. That's why i was wondering if they could approach and ask after article 50 is invoked. Allows people to make a more informed choice.
then our bargening chip with EU becomes harder
We are, the timing she suggested would effectively be after the negotiations are wrapped - there will be a buffer at the end of the negotiation period as it's necessary to pass the deal through all 28 legislative processes.
Hence her speech and time window 
I agree, or the SNP et al will be accused of being EU fifth columnists. 
I am split exactly 50:50 between "make this tiresome business go away" and "Come aheid, ya bas".
I'm fairly sanguine about all this. 18 months is a long time, especially to maintain anger at a political decision. A lot could happen between then and now that could favour both yes and no.   I've had to take stock of my position recently and now I've got prep time, I'm happy that I'm alright. I'll be more than financially secure and yes or no I can weather the storm. In fact given some of things an independent Scotland will need to do I could actually make out like a bandit.  If you are young or a pensioner or infirm in some way, it should really be a no brainer. Why you'd want to put your education, your pension, your medical treatment at risk is beyond me.   There's a lot of water between then and now, Brexit could be a disaster...but then again it might not. Oil prices might hit the heights we saw a few years ago...or could continue to stagnate with the industry in Aberdeen continuing its slide.  One things for sure though, this is the biggest political gambit of Sturgeon's career.
>Why you'd want to put your education, your pension, your medical treatment at risk is beyond me.  I'm not sure if you're commenting on the financial uncertainty following potential Scottish independence or continued Tory rule in Westminster.  The fact that I can't tell those two options apart is quite scary.
But also, in and of itself, not a strong case for either.
I really don't buy into this Tory rule nonsense. There's a reason we have a devolved government in Scotland and that government controls spending on the majority of things that directly affect our lives, health, education, infrastructure, policing, law and order etc. I would seriously doubt an independent Scottish budget would even be equal to the current money spent.   There's very little a Tory government can do to Scotland and even on things like welfare they'll be new powers (delayed by the SNP I might add) to mitigate anything the Tories do there.  The whole Tory boogie man should be consigned to the dustbin, hasn't been relevant for almost 2 decades.
A push for NHS privatization would force the same in Scotland. 
NHS privatisation is a dead cert in an independent scotland.  Scotland's budget deficit is about £10bn, and the Scottish NHS costs £9bn. The bond markets won't lend to you if you continue to have a budget deficit of 9% of GDP, so you'll have to call in the IMF. Look at what the IMF did to Greece's healthcare.  Conversely Scotland leaving will make the NHS's survival in England *more* likely as it will no longer be subsidizing the Scots and no longer be sending money to the EU, and should thus have about £20bn from savings from both, released to put into our own services. Lots in England are in favour of Scotland leaving for that very reason.
You think the Tories are going to put more money into the NHS after Brexit? What's the weather like on your planet?
Are you serious? The tories want to PRIVATISE the NHS. Any savings (if there are any) will go towards the UK's enormous brexit bill.
The Tories have ring-fenced the NHS.  Also, once out of the EU, we can then vote for whomever we want and make our own laws, so we can easily vote for a pro-NHS govt Lab govt if the Tories cut up rough.  The chief constraint is *money*. Without the EU and without the Scots, we have more money to play with and hence more choices.  I definitely think the Scots should consider voting for independence in order to free the English to spend money on themselves. Of course that means the Scots have less to spend, but they should put their Braveheart faces on and explain to themselves that they are undergoing austerity sacrifices for FREEDOM!!!!  Vote Indy for England's sake!
Leaving the EU will save you approximately nothing. You have to pay to trade or watch a large percentage of your economy disappear and then you really will learn austerity.  The whole Scotland costs us thing doesn't really wash. The fact your trying to keep us shows so. Oil isn't our only resource, we have plenty possibilities for energy generation. I heard a part of the west coast has enough energy to fuel to whole of the UK and then some it's just a case of getting the right tech to harness it. 
>Leaving the EU will save you approximately nothing. You have to pay to trade or watch a large percentage of your economy disappear and then you really will learn austerity.  Most of England's trade is with the rest of the world. So no, we won't need to pay to trade, more likely the desperado Europeans will pay us.  >I heard a part of the west coast has enough energy to fuel to whole of the UK and then some it's just a case of getting the right tech to harness it.   Ah, but will England bother to buy it, rather than generate our own electricity? Maybe if the Sturgeon creature promises to crawl naked up the mall, LOL.
Uhm.. https://goo.gl/images/Z4PA8W a little old but enough trade comes from the EU that ur gunna want to trade with them...  And England will use what exactly to make power?
Mate, the English NHS is already fucked. I'll be surprised if it survives till Brexit.
I'm actually more than fairly sure that a independent Scotland in the EU will be more financially secure than a Scotland in the UK but outside the EU having to answer to the tories for 20 more years.
An independent Scotland would at least control all its finances and have some chance at fixing them, whereas in the UK we must be forever be terrified of the UK government eyeing the Barnett formula too closely.
Am independent Scotland fixing its finances? The SNP's budget was £2 billion short when they assumed oil would be at $110/bbl. At our current point, it's hardly worth extracting. An independent Scotland would have to invoke massive cuts and increase taxes massively to even stand a chance while independent. And guess what? The SNP built their reputation on being against cuts and having good social programs. Getting independence and then forcing a removal of such things would be absolutely fucking disgusting of the SNP. 
> The SNP's budget was £2 billion short  As opposed to [this](http://www.nationaldebtclock.co.uk/)? 
Debt is very different to a deficit, especially for a country of 5 million people compared to 65 million. There are also sustainable levels of debt, Scotland's levels of debt would not be sustainable back then (especially so with the oil crisis) and would be far less sustainable now given how the Scottish people are used to a certain level of social programs. 
If you think £2B is a big number for 5 million people you must be doing mental somersaults if you are convincing yourself that £1.8 Trillion is sustainable debt for 65 million people. 
Again, you are comparing deficits to debts, very different things. Keep in mind that Scotland would also take its share of debt to start off with too. Also keep in mind that the current economic climate would mean our deficit would be far larger now without massive spending cuts and big tax increases. 
I was talking simple numbers. Deficit can be a good thing. Debt never is IMO.   > Keep in mind that Scotland would also take its share of debt to start off with too.  It will take its negotiated share, highly unlikely that would be its per capita share since the UK government doesn't invest evenly on a per capita basis across the UK. Also the UK will want to retain much of the assets that the debt was accrued over.  And of course if the negotiations break down the whole debt remains rUKs, so they really will have to come up with a deal.    Fortunately the timing of this referendum will allow us to know what Brexit deal is on the table. No point comparing debt and deficit based on present or past trade. Everything the UK has done up until now will be useless for comparison sake if it heads off the cliff of no deals and off shore tax haven status.   That is what a future Scots economy will be judged against, not the UK's past economy within the EU. 
>Debt never is IMO.  It may not often be good but there is absolutely no denying that there are sustainable levels of debt.   >Deficit can be a good thing.   Eh what?   >if the negotiations break down the whole debt remains rUKs, so they really will have to come up with a deal.  Again, what? We will be told that we take our share of debt, any negotiations will be to lower that share, if negotiations break down we will get the proportional amount, no less. Why would we get the option to not take any debt? If that was the case we'd outright refuse to take debt which I'm sure you know is preposterous. 
Scotland isn't based on oil anymore. We're going for renewables. Like all sensible first world countries
>We're going for renewables.  Which is good, but what does this require? Oh yes, lots of fucking money.   It also doesn't help that the SNP have a moronic, populist hatred of anything nuclear which would supply us with plenty of clean energy. 
> It also doesn't help that the SNP have a moronic, populist hatred of anything nuclear which would supply us with plenty of clean energy.  That I can agree with you on. I don't understand the vehement refusal to consider nuclear power as a stop-gap to full renewables. 
Yeah. The hatred of nuclear is backwards i feel, but no-one is throwing themselves behind it. I also feel that labour and conservatives aren't doing nearly enough for renewables and the conservatives going for fracking is easily one of the worst ideas.
I really doubt fracking is going to happen given the price of oil, that's actually one of the good things about the oil crisis. After all, that is why the KSA started flooding the market in the first place albeit for economic reasons and not for some silly shit like preventing mass water contamination and earthquakes. 
Well EU investment pays for most renewables at least currently
Do you not see the issue with that statement? We are leaving the EU regardless. 
And rejoining again as soon as possible? If Yes wins that is
It would still be years and we'd also have to change our spending habits 
I don't understand this logic. Scotland trades 4x as much with the rest of the UK than the rest of the EU. Leaving the UK won't massively change that. Scotland also has a large deficit and receives far more funding from Westminster than the EU.  I don't think it's likely that Scotland ends up in a better position outside the UK but in the EU compared to vice versa. The EU can't plug the gap caused by leaving the UK.
Scotland will NOT remain in the EU, independent or not.   https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/no-circumstances-scotland-stays-eu-independent-not/amp/  We would have to apply for entry again at the very least. There will also not be any sort of fast track for us which I'm sure the SNP will try to imply that we would. 
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/10/independent-scotland-would-have-to-apply-for-eu-membership   According to this there will be a fast track.
Important to note that 'Fast-Track' is still 3-5 years.  That's plenty of time for economic instability to noticably affect quality of life.
Though that does also note > Minor, who is the commission’s spokeswoman in the UK, also implied that timing could also be an issue since Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the commission, had said he did not want to see any more enlargement of the EU beyond its current 28 members during his term of office. 
Scotland is, by virtue of being in the UK, already a member. Also if the UK leaves and Scotland joins independently, that number doesn't change.  I think most in the EU are favourable to finding a way to keep Scotland in the EU rather than have it accede after first leaving, or if that can't be done due to timing (not becoming independent before UK leaves), then some way of fast-tracking the accession. A large part of why accession to the EU takes so fucking long is getting one's laws aligned with the EU which in the case of Scotland isn't an issue.
The EU have specifically stated that there is no way that Scotland remains in the EU, they will have to re-apply.   You also forget that the EU requires responsible spending and with the state of our economy and the oil market, we'd need to enact massive cuts to join. 
"The EU" has specifically stated absolutely nothing.  
Oh yes, only the member States and their officials but who cares about them right?
Member states are not the EU, and their officials are also not the EU.  Until the EU as an institution brings out an official statement saying such, anything else is hearsay.   I should note that EU officials have also said the opposite. Also hearsay until an official statement is made.
The European Commission have [already made it clear](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-eu-independence-referendum-scotland-join-queue-membership-apply-a7627201.html): > Wading into the debate on the Scottish Government’s plans for a second vote, a spokesman for the European Commission said Scotland would not be granted automatic access to the EU if it split from the rest of the UK.  > At a briefing in Brussels, Margaritis Schinas said: "The commission does not comment on issues that pertain to the internal legal and constitutional order of our member states."  > But he added: "The Barroso doctrine, would that apply? Yes that would apply, obviously."  > Former commission president Jose Manuel Barroso set out the legal view that if one part of an EU country became an independent state it would have to apply for EU membership.  It's certainly true that Scotland has it relatively easy as an applicant by already complying with standards - but we would still be a new applicant from outside the EU.
Even with having to reapply (and that is definitely up in the air despite what you imply), I still think it would be more financially secure than staying tethered to the Brexit corpse of the UK.
It's not up in the air.  Scotland currently doesn't (and wouldn't have for 2+ years) have several functioning institutions it requires to apply for membership. There is no legal framework to allow Scotland to bypass Article 49 currently short of being annexed by a current EU member.  We will be out, and then back in the EU once the application
Either way it's simple.  If you want to live in Scotland and be in the EU (or even just the single market), the only way there's a chance of that after Article 50 is independence.  rUK is heading for a hard Brexit and isn't going to be rejoining.
I'm not sure how much the waters will get muddied in the run up to the vote, but at the outset it looks like a much clearer sovereignty vs economic debate. "Can you tolerate Scotland leaving the EU against your will?" vs "can you tolerate massive service cuts/ tax rises?"  In truth I feel if people were honest with themselves about what each option holds, the majority would think both are pretty terrible deals in comparison to the pre- EU ref situation. I'm pretty on the fence on both which way i think this will go and which way I want it to go, but I do really wish this had been 5 years further down the line.
> "Can you tolerate Scotland leaving the EU against your will?" vs "can you tolerate massive service cuts/ tax rises?"  It's more of an attitude thing to many. England is prepared to take the entire UK out of the EU based on the slimmest of 2% margins while various regions are pushing 10+% majorities in the opposite direction.   Two years ago we were told we were a nation of equals. That very very clearly is not the case. 
I think the majority of MPs from all other nations backed Brexit didn't they, why single out England?  I don't believe many people were under the illusion 2 years ago that a nation of equals would imply a veto over a referendum favoured by the majority of the people in the union. I don't get why this is supposed to be a revelation to anyone who didn't buy already buy the sovereignty arguments last time.
> why single out England?  They are the ones calling the shots.   > ould imply a veto over a referendum favoured by the majority of the people in the union  The slimmest majority possible. You honestly think it's enough to piss off 64+% of Scots based on a majority of 2%? If so, then we got a problem. 
I think this isnt news to anyone. A union of equals never implied a veto over referendums. Honestly you are making the sovereignty argument rest upon imagined grievance when its actually much stronger than that.
> A union of equals never implied a veto over referendums.  Then what *did* it mean? If we don't have an "equal" say in major irreversible decisions then how is that a "nation of equals"? It seems to me more like a case of "younger brother". 
It means people in all nations being equal, presumably. Someone in Scotland had an equal say in this major irreversible decision as someone in England, Wales etc. Why would equality demand a veto?
Then it means nothing surely? It certainly flies against what I would say was the implied sentiment of the statement in the context of the time it was spoken.  It's the having "nation" word in there that's the problem, the debate is over whether "nation of equals" is referring to the constituent parts of the UK, verses a straight population share. If it's the latter then it was just empty words as the UKs voting system has that by default and has done since full enfranchisement came into place. The context in which it was spoken though was a time when Scotland was debating leaving with one of the key complaints being the lack of a voice at UK level.  It's very open to interpretation and vague, which isn't all that surprising from a politician in any camp!

Eh am I not outright stating the opposite?
Ah, my mistake, comment deleted. 
With regards to the oil, the prices will not get anywhere near what we saw just before the referendum any time soon, especially between now and the referendum.   The proposed budget for an independent Scotland was still £2 billion short assuming oil would be at $110/bbl. Now it's barely even worth extracting north sea oil, nothing gets extracted unless it's over ~$70/bbl. Our budget would be in tatters and there is no way we could sustain our current social programmes in the current economic climate.   It also doesn't help that the SNP were reluctant to even acknowledge that Aberdeen currently has a huge employment crisis. That does not bode well for how they're going to deal with oil and the budget. 
Aberdeen won't ever be the same again. It's shite, but it won't be. 
She doesn't have any choice. If she didn't take it now, what would people think?
I feel like announcing this on Commwelth day is pretty ironic.
I mean the main thing the commonwealth has in common is that they left Britain
Do an Irish goodbye and never come back.
It seems a much simpler choice this time.  If you want to be part of the UK outwith the EU, under Tory rule, either trading on poorer terms than as a member of the EU or under WTO terms as an offshore low wage, low service economy then vote to stay. Many will want that.  If you do not want that, then vote to leave.
Lots being said about Scotland being outside both the EU and the UK at the same time.  If Scotland votes to leave the UK it will take years to actually leave, and there is no reason that things can't be kicked off to join the EU to run in tandem with that timescale.  The day Scotland leaves the UK can be the day it joins the EU if things are planned that way. 
I'm not sure on the legality of that. I mean, it might be a similar dealio to how the UK can't actually negotiate trade deals until the leaving process is complete - not simply once we're committed to leaving.
A state with a democratic independence date set isn't the same as a region of a member state though, is it?  Rules are rules, but for new circumstances new rules have to be made.  The EU is not against expansion. 
Why don't the tories come up with a post brexit vow, then just shutdown holyrood instead, I mean it isn't beyond them to pull something like that. :)
The "beauty" of their Vow published in the Daily Record before the first referendum was that it wasn't official in any way, shape or form. It did appear as such at a glance though, which made it very effective.  I don't believe it'll work a second time, and everyone will be wiser this time around.
American here. So let me get this straight, y'all are going to get independence from England, just to join a larger more distant governing body?
> American here. So let me get this straight, y'all are going to get independence from England, just to join a larger more distant governing body?  Despite what the Brexit press like to tell people, the EU doesn't really have that much say in day-to-day affairs. It's much less powerful than, say, the US federal government. It's mostly still about international trade. So yes, as a small country I think having control over our own affairs, but access to (and a voice in) the world's largest trading bloc is the best of both worlds and very desirable indeed.
Really, the EU is just the governing body for the EFTA/EEA single market. 
You mean the EU, which they had been members of as part of GB and majority of Scotland had voted to remain with?  It'd be "rejoin" not "join."
Most of scotlands trade is with the UK, Nicola is using Brexit as an excuse to get a 2nd chance at independence. There should be no referendum for at least 10 years.     I find it funny how she keeps saying Scotland voted to remain in Europe but then ignores those that voted to stay in the U.K.  
They voted to stay in the UK because they were told a "Yes" for Scotland would be a vote to leave Europe.  
That wasn't the only reason. But in my opinion to was a big one. 
Maybe they should be asking for a 2nd brexit vote based on the fact the leave campaign lied instead of a 2nd independence vote then.      The SNP main agenda is just to leave, it's alls they want and if it was not brexit it would be something else in the next couple of years. 
There was a big campaign for a second vote but it was shot down. Since then Nicola and presented several options including Scotland being both part of the EU and the UK and that too was ignored
If by join you mean continue to remain in then yes.
This is not and has never been an option on the table. Scotland is not a member nation of the EU, it never has been. It must join, not rejoin, not remain.
What? There is no official EU position on this matter, and it can be argued that treaties can be amended such that Scotland could "inherit" EU membership. (Although Spain wouldn't be happy with this with Catalonia, but my guess is the rest of the EU would tell Spain to fuck off since they have sucked up a lot of money).
Their official position is what they have on paper until they decide to change it in some way, They have no process for seceding regions inheriting EU membership at this point and it'd be a stretch for them to implement anything of the sort without first taking a stance.
"more distant". Geographically maybe, but Westminster has never given two shits about Scotland either. 
I see no reason why Brussels would.
It's like moving out your maws gaff cos she keeps making you do the dishes but she only makes ready meals for tea, and moving in with your pals, who can be pricks sometimes but at least they don't do the ironing in the skud.
>  just to join a larger more distant governing body?  Westminster has proven themselves to be capable of being so distant they may as well be on Pluto
Yes. An EU that is definitely flawed, but an EU that we in Scotland already voted to remain in by 62%/38%.  And we will be an independent country on an equal standing with the rUK and not some pseudo region within a UK government we no longer trust to act in anyone's interests other than London and the Home Counties in the south of England.
Just following in the footsteps of thirteen colonies that left the UK back in 17something. Not sure what happened to them, I don't hear much about 13 colonies any more.
Do you think the US should come back under British rule?  Being a member of the EU has many perks and gives access to the free market. Also EU Members vote people to the European Parliament and countries take it in turns to control the presidency of the EU.   Also voting in MEPs uses a proportional representation system which the Scottish Government also uses. The UK government does not.   The EU's policies and beliefs are far more aligned with the Scottish Governments than the Scottish and Westminster Governments are. For the last two elections the UK has voted in a Tory government but for the last four elections Scotland has only elected one Tory MP in each of those elections. One single MP.   Westminster does not best serve Scotland's interests and right not, the UK is made up of over ten times the population of Scotland. We are not all that aligned in our priorities and Scotland would be in a far better place governed by itself.    
Not sure this makes sense. Proportionally even as 10% of the UK population, this is far greater than the % of the EU population. Also Scotland has a higher number of MPs than it's population would suggest under PR. So by definition it's UK influence is higher than it's EU influence. Scotland also gets significantly more funding per head from Westminster and fiscal transfers far exceed payments from the EU to Scotland. Even with goodwill the EU isnt going to magic up tens of billions to give to Scotland.  You're right that Scottish politics are not the same as in England right now, but it wasn't exactly that long ago when it was with labor. Things change, basing a fundamental political difference off a few electoral cycles doesn't seem to make sense to me.  I think a large part of the difference in politics is cause by different immigration rates. Immigration has been very low in Scotland but massively high in some areas of England. Generally, high immigration over time causes the population to shift more right wing as the local poorer population gets work displaced, this is true pretty much for every country. If Scotland begins to get higher immigration (as is SNP policy) then you could see a similar shift.  
I'm not sure why you think Scotland has a higher number of MPs than our population would suggest under PR. Around 10% of the population and 10% of the MPs. I'd say that is about right so not sure what you are getting at there.   The more funding per head is constantly mentioned when talking about indyref. However that funding doesn't just pay for people, so not sure what picture people are trying to paint when they bring that up but it isnt an accurate one. The Barnet formula is a joke and even Lord Barnet said it should be scrapped.   That spending pays for infrastructure not just people. Scotland has 32% of the land mass of the UK but only receives 9.3% of public spending. We have 8.3% of the population but attribute 9.1% of tax revenue.   There difference in politics far extends passed immigration. Scotland might swing more to the right in the future, Westminster might swing more to the left. That doesnt really make a difference just because Scotland is generally in line with my political beliefs just now my beliefs dont change. If Scotland was independent then it would always have the people in power the people of Scotland wish to have in power. Left or right it doesnt matter, as you said political climates change but at least then we are in control and accountable. Rather than holding out for the UK political climate to match our own. 
So I'm pro indy but can I ask where you get the tax stats from? I'd have thought of that was true you'd see the good old ,"you guys cost us money" much less often
Those tax stats are from the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) from just before indyref. They will have changed a bit now with the change in Oil but then Oil isnt calculated properly in them.   The point was focusing on the spend per head does not paint an accurate picture. That's probably why the pro-indy camp didn't latch on to those two percentages which is what they were during indyref. 
I'm gunna have to look it up again that's pretty interesting
The EU isn't a governing body in the sense of being a nation state. In most cases, it's simply the means of agreeing upon rules for the single market. Think of NAFTA but where people could actually vote. In that sense, it's actually not bad; at least it operates on PR unlike the UK too.
Depending on your state we might be physically closer to Brussels than you are to Washington. Furthermore Scotland is much closer politically to many of the European states than it is to England these days
Yeah, but American culture is much more cohesive than verious European cultures.
I disagree. California is vastly different from any of the southern states and new York isn't much like the Midwest. There are themes sure but the same can be said of Europe
Also....they could just call our bluff and get special treatment
Auld Alliance will resurect ! Bonne chance my friends.
/u/DemonEggy is a petty tyrant!

How does it give other Brits the opportunity to remain within the EU? 
If they move to Scotland before independence, they will gain citizenship.
Uprooting your entire life for the possibility of EU citizenship isn't exactly that appealing...
Probably not. Just stating that citizenship would be possible that way.
[deleted]
Uprooting your entire life for the possibility of EU citizenship isn't exactly that appealing, and I say that as a diehard Europhile.
I think a post-brexit vote would have a considerably different outcome.
This was a nice move by Nicola Sturgeon. After weeks and weeks of waiting for Theresa May to trigger Article 50 it is obvious they are just playing for time. Sturgeon took the initiative and basically put ball back in May's court.   I think initially her plan was to announce the referendum after Article 50 was triggered. However, it was becoming more and more apparent that Article 50 kept getting pushed back as we all know May has no real plan. She had no choice, and at this point now May must declare the Article 50 or she will lose so much face it will be sad.   
This is the biggest gamble of Sturgeon's political existence and I also think she has made the wrong choice. The polls are not yet right and the prospects are too uncertain. I admire her courage, but I think she is a fool.   I hope we do vote to be a nation once again - but I won't put money on it. 
It could be argued, running this campaign when Westminster is distracted and too busy negotiating with the EU to lovebomb Scotland this time around is actually the canniest time to hold an independence referendum. While your opposition is in disarray and all that. Expect to see May pushing for this to be held after Brexit has concluded. 
There are reports on sky that she was bounced into it by Alex Salmond and his supporters against her better judgement.  That would certainly tally with his recent pointed refusal to rule out a return to leadership.
Do you actually think Sturgeon is capable of being bounced into doing anything she doesn't want to? I always thought Salmond's role these days was Sturgeon's useful provocateur-in-London, while she got to appear all stateswoman-like and not getting her hands dirty.   Salmond's prime talent being winding up the politicians and media in Westminster by coming out with controversial statements, but actually preparing the ground for what the party is intending on doing.  For what it's worth, [Salmond's twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexSalmond/status/841319042845724675) is saying Sky have fallen hook-line-and-sinker for some line the Number 10 press office have fed them (I paraphrase obviously).
No thanks!
Still eating yer cereal, Paul?
Yup. Fuck knows what Britain is doing but simply enough, we don't have enough money coming in to maintain our lifestyles without the money coming from the Barnett formula. We have a huge deficit and there's no way the UK is gunna let us leave with less than our fair share of the UK debt. EU membership is unlikely between Spain and the deficit requirements.  Throwing everything away in the pursuit of blind nationalism is just as stupid as everything UKIP have done. The SNP have put us in a great position atm, being a looming threat to the UK that keeps us on the political map, obviously with the number of seats we have in Westminster we're the only part of the UK (other than the square mile ofc!) that really has strong regional representation.  Add in the fact that nearly all our trade is with the UK, so regardless of EU membership or not tarrifs would be a real problem. Also regardless of whether we joined the Schengen or not, there would likely have to be a real border which feels stupid after these hundreds of years. If the UK couldn't come to some agreement about existing "migrants" from the EU that could create a social disaster too (I doubt it'd be a problem if we weren't in the EU but the whole point of the EU is blanket agreements with all the countries, no exceptions)  Additionally we would be abandoning the rest of the UK to further domination by the south and the Tories. The current situation is not a Scottish sovereignty problem its a "What the fuck are you doing Labour?" issue. The whole UK has the same issue, the Tories have absolute control because there's no opposition. Wouldn't be surprised if people outside Scotland would vote for the SNP if they could, just because they oppose the Tories and have their shit in order. Corbyn's gotta go before Labour is actually flat out dead or the Liberal Democrats have gotta pull of some kinda miracle. If someone competent gets control of Labour and champions a sensible moderate left wing economic policy, social justice and a second referendum on Brexit, they will win, 100%, damn near every damn "remoaner" will vote for them which already gives them a bigger lead in the popular vote than any victor we've had in decades.
Do studies exist that show that we don't currently have enough income to be self-sufficient?  Also, if NI and ROI don't have a hard border, why would Scotland and RUK? I'm not necessarily challenging you, I'm just interested to know these things 
>Do studies exist that show that we don't currently have enough income to be self-sufficient?  Yes. The SNP were planning to heavily rely on oil last time around. Even then the economic argument left a lot to be desired. With the north sea in total collapse plus the damaging tarrifs likely to be implemented with UK trade, there's a serious economic problem with the leave argument. >Also, if NI and ROI don't have a hard border, why would Scotland and RUK? I'm not necessarily challenging you, I'm just interested to know these things   Because the UK hasn't left the EU yet. There's a lot of talks about whether some arrangement can be had for the Irish border. Neither the UK or ROI is in the Schengen so are in control of much of their own border policy, with the Good Friday Agreements currently controlling that border. However these exemptions to rules are not allowed for new members, new member states have to implement the Schengen as well as other requirements. That takes the power to have an open border policy with the UK out of Holyroods hands if they join the EU.   Protecting the Good Friday Agreement is one of the many things the UK is looking for in this "deal" everyone keeps going on about. The EU wasn't super bothered about it before because it was ultimately free movement between 2 EU countries which had the same border policy towards other EU members. However freedom of movement into an EU country which implements the free movement policy of the Schengen basically means the UK gets freedom of movement as well, which the EU will slap down without membership fees and the daily mail will say is a backdoor for rapefugees or something like that.
If Scotland votes no after this whole Brexit fiasco then it puts the case to bed for a long time. 
If Scotland votes no, I don't think there will be another referendum in my lifetime. Then I didn't think Brexit would happen either.
I genuinely believe Scotland will be independent within the next 30 years. I don't believe we will within the next 5. 
Yeah....Or more likely not
It's just the country's circumstances have changed so drastically with Brexit I don't see how another referendum cannot happen. If there was no brexit this wouldn't have been a thing for years to come
Brexit has been convenient for the snp true. But they would have just found some other injustice against the Scots to really behind. They could of course campaign for another EU membership referendum....
what sense would that have? Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and it didn't matter a shit. 
They also voted overwhelming to stay in the UK and it didn't matter a shit. 
Overwhelmingly is being generous here and we both know that. But it doesn't change the fact that the circumstances have drastically changed with Scotland being essentially taken out of the EU against the people's will. If it's another no vote then ok but to say we can't have another one is bollocks. Scotland should have the right to vote on whatever matter the people want. That's the point of a democracy in my opinion. 
Why should i believe that they would respect the outcome of the second referendum? 
What do you mean by respect? In my opinion the result was respected in the sense it was accepted and we went about our business for the most part. It's not as if it was a no and people started blowing shit up.  If by respect you mean never again campaign for it then no that won't happen. Probably ever. There is a % of die hard nationalists who will never give up campaigning for Independence. To me that's not a problem, if or when it generates enough public fervour then we all vote. This vote once forever is not how democracy works. Politics are fluid.
So what happens if there is another no vote? What do the SNP do then?
But Scotland was included in the vote on Brexit. They shouldn't have another referendum just because they didn't get the result they wanted. 
Included yes but much like the UK general elections we are outnumbered to the point we don't have an effect on the final result.  And it's not about doing it because we didn't get the result we wanted, it's doing it because the circumstances have changed from where we voted first time.  Let's see how the country votes when a yes vote is a vote is to also remain in Europe as opposed to the first time round where a yes vote was also a vote to leave Europe.  Is that not fair?
Nope. There shouldn't be another referendum every time something changes. Because things will always be changing.  And Scottish votes count the same as everyone else's votes. Each individual person is outnumbered; that's not an argument.
> There shouldn't be another referendum every time something changes.  There should be another vote because the SNP and Greens were voted in with the promise of another referendum in these circumstances with over 50% of the vote.
We are different countries with different views. Our country does not want to leave the EU. England wants to leave. There are far more voters in england. Imagine there's a group of 10 people . 9 want to do something and you, the tenth dont. But they put it to a vote so now you need to do it because it was a fair vote. Why are you so afraid of another vote? I think that because things are always changing it makes sense to always be open to votes. 
It doesn't matter that there are more voters in England, because we are all part of the UK and it is as the UK that we voted. There are various ways you can group the vote - by age or whatever - and they don't matter. Geographic doesn't matter either. The margin by which Leave won was so small that the population of Scotland was easily enough to change the result, had they all voted.  If every time you lose a vote, you wait 3 years and then have another one, eventually you may get the result you want just because people get bored of voting for the status quo. The Scottish referendum was supposed to settle the matter for a generation. That's why I'm opposed to having another vote.  It's precisely because things are always changing that we shouldn't keep re-voting. They were making the choice for the next several decades. Of course things will change in that time.
It'll be interesting tae see whut the opposition comes up wae tae scare the voters intae voting no. They cannae fall for thur pish again this time, can they?    Surely no'...
suicide ferries has already been put out there on the BBC
Ah, still pushing the ~~idea~~ lie that people were 'scared' into voting no, and unable to make their own informed decisions I see.
No, no' at all, am no' that glaikit tae think that.    Tae say that ALL those who voted 'No' wur scared intae it would be a lie, but tae say that a LOT of those people who voted 'No' *were* scared intae it, isnae! If you firmly believe that naeb'dy wis scared intae voting 'No' fae the shite that wis spoken, then yir heed's up yir arse...
scaring and threating old people is something the tories excell at
> but tae say that a LOT of those people who voted 'No' were scared intae it, isnae!  I mean, there's absolutely no evidence to back that up, but sure, there's no way you're just making it up!
Naw, naw, am sure there is evidence oot there, likes, bit tae be honest wae ye, a' cannae be arsed lookin'. Like a' said, a lot of people were scared intae it fae the garbage and lies spoken by the opposition. They wur panickin' like fuck... and it showed!
The way you type only fortifies the stereotype of the ned yes voter. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmGjiokfQ2A  I got your stereotype right here. This your bunch is it?

A' hear masel' fine, pal...
Yes.
The cringe is strong with this one. 
Because I don't type like a complete fuckwit?
Because you shame those who type in scots.
It looks moronic, just like a chav who types lyk dis wiv an accent lyk dis bruv.
There's plenty of evidence mate. Apparently voting yes meant voting SNP and the SNP were secretly fascist. It meant losing your pension, losing the NHS, not having any currency, the absolute slander campaign ran by the BBC, we wouldn't be in NATO and Russia would invade us.  Oh and my absolute favourite, if Scotland becomes independent they won't be able to get into the EU.
Or get to watch Dr. Who.
 Speak English for fucks sake.

Listen, if ye cannae read whit am typin' then jist leave it. Nae cunt's askin' ye tae read it, for fuck's sake.    Oh, by the way, we also speak Scots here!!!
What's wrong with someone in r/Scotland speaking Scots? He's Scottish and that's how most people in Scotland speak. It's folk like you that won't be happy until bridies are called pasties and ceilidhs are replaced by morris dancing 
Keep up the patronising tone. You aren't alienating anyone, no-sir-ee.
Aye mind when Leave used the whole "fear" stance? That worked fuckin great didn't it?
Now I get to endure a whole year and a half of wondering who is actually running the country whilst the parties in power are busy campaigning and providing zero actual evidence either way.  Thanks Sturgeon.
There has to be a caveat for a 60% plus majority or there's no victory.  We've seen how easily the public can be misled and exploited emotionally with Brexit and exactly what mess that leads to. It is far too soon for another.
> There has to be a caveat for a 60% plus majority or there's no victory.  Before, I'd have agreed. However, we're about to be fucked by a 4% difference between the two sides in Brexit, so it would be pretty unfair for us to have to get a far higher result in order to leave the sinking ship.
I'm a pro-remain, pro-union Londoner who was opposed to the previous independence referendum. This time, I fully support every Scot's right to leave this shit show of a union. I just wish London would do the same.
if people in London hate the Union because it doesn't work, it Shows the Union doesnt work
Another Londoner here. I don't hate the union, far from it, I love the fact that different parts of the UK have their own identities and cultures, the UK is a better place for it.  
tell those who voted to leave the EU on back of immigration that, see what response you get
I'm not convinced that's a valid point. Despite there being cultural differences between parts of the UK these cultures are fundamentally British as they belong to the kingdoms that joined together to form the UK back in 1707.  There is therefore an innate difference between British cultural variations within the UK and those that are "imported" via immigration. This must surely be recognised regardless of opinions on immigration.
umm you do realise we're not an empire any more right??  and no, it shouldn't we're all people, culture enriches us, yes there has been an issue with islamist culture, mainly down south, it's not a problem here, but then we do at least try to intergrate people where as minorities are all but ignored in England and Walse
this guy gets it.
I thought the 4% difference in Brexit shows just how stupid it is to make a huge constitutional decision based on a simple majority.
I agree and I'd accept a 60% majority for independence the day that Westminster accepts a 60% majority for brexit. Otherwise it just seems like moving the goalposts
"They did it first" hasn't worked as an excuse since I was five.
If we never get over past results from a shitty system then we can never change it. 
And what better way to change the system than to beat it with its own faults and change it ourselves?
So change it after you exploit what you want from the old system? That's just shitty. 
In what way? We have a fairer voting system in Scotland, there is no precedent for a supermajority in a referendum... I don't see the issue personally
A referendum on independence should have a supermajority as it is such a huge, irreversible decision. 
So your saying that the majority of a population should suck it because big changes are scarey that pretty stupid. Changes of government are scarey too let's just always keep the previous one unless we can get a 60% vote for change?
I certainly empathise with that viewpoint but I completely agree with the Americans and Dawkins that constitutional change should be very hard to do. We shouldn't want to be as free to make short sighted and ill informed decisions as the UK did with the EU.  Imagine how bitter that divide will be when a new country is to be founded by a majority that slim. Brexit has split Britain right down the middle in quite an ugly fashion but I guarantee this will be worse if a similar thing happens. I couldn't care less about what is seen as fair, I care about good governance and stability which we won't get with a narrow independence vote. The flag that flies and the national anthem matter very little to me, I'm totally open to Scotland gradually becoming independent in say 20 years. If it happens too fast though it will become bitter. It already is. I used to argue it had ended amicably but in the years since I've felt the political landscape in this country turn evermore sour.  What's more if you do it that way and it's a close loss for Yes then the question still won't have been put to bed because it wouldn't be a real victory for No either. Without that? It's over for a long time.
> I completely agree with the Americans and Dawkins that constitutional change should be very hard to do.  Yes, America is certainly an example of a well run country that never elects idiots.  The opposite is true.  A constitution that can be changed by parliamentary majority is in a sense fragile, but it can also empower democracy.  A large part of the reason we are seeing rises in popular politics is that mainstream democrats like to pretend their hands are tied to wriggle out of tricky decisions.  It makes people who espouse easy answers more attractive.
He is referring to constitutional change, not an election, a constitutional change still requires far more support than whatever idiots the republicans elected. 
If you think I don't understand that, please re-read for further information.
A secular democracy with checks and balances that are proving a substantial hindrance to Trump right now.  If he'd got in the UK all he'd need is a narrow majority to rewrite the Constitution. It is a far superior system for that kind of massive change.
> If  Which is rather my point.  Such systems tend to encourage extremists.  In the UK, our extremists have one MP, and him only because he defected so as not to derail Brexit.
I'm not sure I follow your reasoning.  Trump has more or less the full support of the Republican party who won big. Yet it is still incredibly difficult to go full Breitbart because it violates an excellent constitution which cannot change without a 2/3 majority.  That was my point. Perhaps I've been unclear.
Trump has nothing like the full support of the Republican party (the disunity of American party politics is a subject for another day).  My point is that an a constitutionally fragile system *Trump would not have been elected*.  It is *because* American institutions are so broken - which they certainly are - that a Trump-style figure has been able to win an election.  America's constitution is not the only thing to blame but it carries a large part of the weight.    The parallels with the Reform debates of the 1820s are amusing, to say the least.
I agree with this. If I could retcon Brexit I'd also make the same suggestion there. I've grown increasingly tired recently of small margins dictating large shifts in constitution and the politicians negotiating on my behalf declaring that there is a "clear mandate" for Brexit, or independence, or whatever they are arguing for.  To me, 51%, 55% is not a "clear mandate". It's a divided country, a divided country you have asked to make a major political decision. I am currently undecided on how I want to vote, I just hope that this time the evidence we are provided with to make our decision is processed by experts and not bigots (expert bigots fall in the latter camp).  Edit: Forgot to mention my main point. If there is a small margin of victory <60% either way, we should be debating compromise - not "hard" exits and burning of bridges.   I also hope that voter turnout is just as high this time. It's a long way away, but try to stay informed people! I'd also suggest keeping an eye on whether the remain and independence parties are actually doing their part to run the country whilst they are busy spending time and money on this issue, we have deep issues to deal with that aren't independence related. 
I'd definitely agree with that, yes.  Sadly Scottish politics is fast becoming one dimensional and all about the constitutional question. The SNP seem to have that and centralising power to Edinburgh as preparation for independence as their priority. To be honest it suits the Tories too. No one seems to compromise even if it's a good idea for fear of admitting wrong doing or weakness.  No one has to actually govern, just pander to their support base and it feels quite hopeless sometimes.
How about a 60%+ NO vote, or it's an automatic yes?  No? Not tickle your fancy? Didn't think so.
It's a constitutional change.  It requires a substantial majority, not independence at all costs. You've wrongly painted me as some staunch No voter. It's good governance, not a fix.
> It's good governance, not a fix.  Most of the time I'd agree with you. Suggesting it now absolutely looks like a fix.
I've felt this way for years is all but I understand why you may see it as that.
Don't be disingenuous, independence is a massive, irreversible decision and should not be decided by a few percent majority. Your plan would force independence on a majority, changing the status quo in an extremely unfair way. 
Both ways potentially force a position against the majority, is the point.  Would you *really* stand up and argue that a 59.9% YES vote shouldn't be considered a democratic mandate just because it fell short of the number someone pulled out their arse and described as 'good enough'?  Brexit happened on 52%, why shouldn't independence happen on 59%?
I don't think that it's a good thing that Brexit happened with such a slim win. I do think that we need to forget past results and reform the system so that such massive changes cannot be made by such slim majorities.   60% is not a random number, that number accounts for the fact that it might have been a spur of the moment act. The country, as a CLEAR majority needs to make such a decision and be sure about it. 
How are you going to get those reforms put into law. Have a referendum?
So are they going to lower the age of people who can vote even further to try and cancel out the votes from those terrible older people who voted no, but only voted no because they were scared, not because they were capable of making their own decisions?  This time it should be open to all Scottish people, whether they live in Scotland or not. You want the Scottish people to be heard? Let them *all* be heard.
The people are of Scotland are the people who LIVE in Scotland. It doesn't matter where you are born. If you have packed up your life and made your home in another country, your opinion on the future of Scotland's independence does not factor into this - it's the people who it will affect who should vote. 
Sadly there are still people who will be disenfranchised - non-EU, non-commonwealth, etc.
Which is not fair at all I agree.

It is only fair to allow those who live and work in Scotland, who contribute to our economy and are affected by the choices that are made in governing this country, are given the right to vote. People born in Scotland who build their lives elsewhere should not get a say. You don't get to choose where you are born, but people who chose to make their life here are just as Scottish as you or me.
> but people who chose to make their life here are just as Scottish as you or me.     FUCK OFF YOU STUPID TWAT NOBODY THINKS THIS YOU FUCKING CUNTS WILL NEVER WIN INDYREF2 SPOUTING THIS BULLSHIT, SOMEONE FROM PAKISTAN MOVING TO SCOTLAND DOESN'T MAKE THEM SCOTTISH, IF I MOVE TO JAPAN THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME JAPANESE, QUIT MAKING AN ARSE OF THIS COUNTRY YOU FUCKING MORON LITERALLY NO OTHER COUNTRY THINKS THE WAY YOU DO, FUCK OFF TO SWEDEN YOU PIECE OF SHIT, I SWEAR IF I EVER FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU LIVE I'LL FUCKING TORCH YOUR HOUSE YOU FUCKING DIRTY COMMUNIST MARXIST LEFTIE CUNT PIECE OF SHIT BASTARD FUCK YOU, BEING SCOTTISH IS NOT A FUCKING FREE FOR ALL FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU.
Hahahahaha absolute state of ye
I hope your next shites a hedgehog.
Going to leave this comment here for posterity. Kind of hope this cunt will read it again when they hit puberty and realise what a 42 carat bellend they are. 
Lol
lol  This can't be real. Are you actually like this in-person?
I was born in Scotland yet my livelihood depends on my EU citizenship, so despite not living in Scotland, I do have a stake in the outcome. Should I not have a say in what may change my life or am I shunned into being rUK.  I get what you mean, day to day of course how Scotland works isnt really for me to decide but if the very nature of my rights and citizenship is called into question, should I not have a say?   
Genuinely I can understand you feeling sore about it because it will directly affect your life.. but the issue is it will affect your life which is outside of Scotland.   The decision should be on whether being out of the rUk is better for the people who live and work in Scotland not how it will affect people outside of Scotland.   If for example, the best thing overall for those who stayed in Scotland was to remain with the rUK outside of Europe then that is the decision that should be taken - or vice versa.     
And thats the crux of our differing opinions. A decision this large should account for everyone in Scotland or outside. Its not funny to mess up peoples lives the results of which have just as big an impact wherever someone is  Theresa May nailed it when she made her "citizen of nowhere" speech. I cant be British because who knows what rights ill have, not eligible for an EU country passport, and cant vote in the country that would dictate my future status. Disenfranchised much. I just dont see how its right that any person can take my rights away from me as an EU citizen, no matter if its 1 person or 64 million. Surely thats my right irregardless.  
Your rights are already being taken away as an EU citizen by Brexit.
And thats not right either but it doesnt make denying me a vote right does it?
You don't get a vote because you no longer live and contribute to the country. You live and work elsewhere.
And if Scotland votes no I have the real possibility of being forced to live and work there post-brexit.  Or anywhere else in the UK.   Im not saying you're wrong all I want to do is point out the importance of the vote and that a dismissive attitude toward people that it will effect wont do anyone any favours.  Its messy for sure but i know the best result would be whatever results in the continuing of free movement of people.   Scotland in EEA/EU/Bespoke deal  Independent/not   either works but in the current reality of things that seems to be an independent Scotland in Europe.
An independent Scotland in Europe is what the SNP has advocated for since at least they got into Holyrood.
What about expats with strong family ties in Scotland and who regularly repatriate/invest money in Scotland? Do you still consider them to not be among the people of Scotland?
If you do not live and work in Scotland, you don't get a say.
you chose to leave so no,  you don't pay taxes here, you gave up the right to vote here but gained the right to vote where you live now when you left Scotand
But I do get to vote in General Elections or EU referendums. Come on man its not a stretch to give the vote this important to those its going to effect.
I don't think you should get to vote in these either. It's not personal.
you want a vote come back, simple.  and how is it going to AFFECT you, you don't live here
I've already explained this. We are on the same side surely you want as many people in favour of independence the ability to vote.
of course, but then you'll get every tom dick and harry claiming I have Scottish Grandparents I have a right to vote coming outta the wood work and within the UK terms that's bad for us.  You have to draw a line somewhere
Well draw the line at whomever would be eligible for Scottish citizenship. Show a birth certificate away you go. Unless you are suggesting I shouldn't have citizenship granted based on the country of my birth? Its ok if not many countries don't confer automatic citizenship like that. 
so that means all English people and foreigners who live here shouldn't get a vote?
If your livelihood depends on your EU citizenship then you should be supporting independence, because if we remain within the UK your loss of EU citizenship is guaranteed.
If you are Scottish, you should have the right to vote on Scotland's future. People who left Scotland for other countries are not banned from returning, they are not former Scottish people.  The people of Scotland already voted no, now we're being told we have to vote again. Everyone should get a vote.
I agree the people of Scotland should decide, however I disagree with you on who the people of Scotland are for the purposes of this vote. I believe the people of Scotland are those who LIVE in Scotland regardless of where they originated from.  Obviously some distinction has to be made in terms of people who are here purely on a temporary basis, I'll concede to that...  However, I don't believe wee Mary who headed out to Spain to run a bar and has no intention of coming back should get a say in how the country I live and work in functions or decides their future. It has no bearing on her life. She may want a say, but whether she should be entitled to it is up for debate.   Edit: missed a word!
> It has no bearing on her life.  Well, since listening to people is so important to you, listen to me: it matters to me.  It is important to me.  It is my country.  I want a say.  I put up with this bullshit last time because I didn't want the Yes camp to have any wriggle room about blaming the overseas vote or the this or the that.  But they can't take a clear answer, so fuck it.  I want my say this time.  I have a view of what's best for Scotland and it's just as valid as any other cunt's.  
Not if your not going to be here to suffer/prosper from the consequences of the vote.  You did nothing clever by being pushed out in Scotland. If you left your country good on you I hope your life is great but you shouldn't expect to choose hows its run when you don't plan to come back. When you sell ur house you give up the right to mow the lawn or choose the position of the garden furniture  Edit: actually your opinion is valid but I don't think your vote should be. Have opinions, Express them but I hope you don't get a vote
I don't disagree that you have an opinion, should have an opinion and are entitled to your opinion. I disagree that your opinion translates into a vote that will determine the outcome to an indyref 2.0 .  I don't hold any stock with ethnic nationalism, as far as I am concerned if you live and work in Scotland you are Scottish. If you were born here but made your life elsewhere I don't think that you should get a vote in this.    
> If you were born here but made your life elsewhere I don't think that you should get a vote in this.  Agreed. Blood-and-soil is utter pish. Those who are over here, contributing to the economy and community are welcome to vote. Those who aren't are welcome to their opinion. 
> People who left Scotland for other countries are not banned from returning  You're right, they're not banned, so they can come back and live here if they want a vote. I've got absolutely no time for ethnic nationalism.
actally I think there should be a limit of that you have had to have been living here over the last two years.  This stops people in England coming up, buying houses and regerserting to vote when they have no real right to
I agree that the situation you describe would be pretty shite ethically for those that were engaging in such behaviour, but I don't think it would occur in adequate numbers to effect the vote in a meaningful way.
well when you look at the last ref it was only lost on 250000 votes, that's not in the realm of impossibility
> that's not in the realm of impossibility  Sure. But I feel it's very unlikely.
>People who left Scotland for other countries are not banned from returning  practically though it's not really possible for most as they have commitments- say a Scot working in England, married, kids, mortgage etc. He can't just up sticks from his life and go back to Scotland to register to vote.
If he doesn't live in Scotland, why should he get a say? He's obviously not planning on coming back, so the effect of the referendum is going to be minimal on him. 
>He can't just up sticks from his life and go back to Scotland to register to vote.  He can if he keeps a second home in Scotland purely for voting purposes...  *coughwappingitecough*
Then you don't get a vote. 
If that is his situation, then Scotland's independence will have little impact on him, since he has made his life in England. He should not get a vote any more than his English neighbour should.
This may be controversial, but I think it was wholeheartedly wrong that last time round Scots living in England couldn't vote, but EU migrants who may have only been here for a few months could.  I'm not meaning to hate on EU migrants, but if it was the other way round and I had just moved to, say, Barcelona, I wouldn't expect to be given a vote on Catalonian independence.
what about in the rUK? They havent gone abroad. Indeed by default an indyref is about breaking up the UK so if anything Scots living in the rUK should have more of a right to vote because a breakup affects them a lot more than Scots remaining in Scotland.  I'm sick of the nationalist rhetoric that if you've been forced to leave Scotland to get work (because it was either that or the dole line) you've somehow 'betrayed Scotland', even though in many parts of Scottish life getting a job is dependent on nepotism and connections.  >The people are of Scotland are the people who LIVE in Scotland  nope, it's much more wider than that.
Do you think the rest of the EU should have been able to vote on Brexit? 
[deleted]
That's not what I asked... 
no of course not. can't you see there is a clear difference. brexit wasn't about destroying the EU, it was a sovereign country leaving. Indyref is abut breaking up a sovereign state  An EU national in the UK is in a foreign country. A Scot in the rUK isn't in a foreign country, he's still in his own country (and I mean sovereign country here)
> brexit wasn't about destroying the EU  ScotRef isn't about destroying the UK, it is about returning sovereignty to one of the Nation States.
>Indyref is abut breaking up a sovereign state  It's actually about restoring the sovereignty of one and not affecting another.
but in practice it is about breaking up a sovereign state. Do you think a Scot settled down in England with career, family mortgage etc cares about legalistic constitutional arguements and pre 1707 constitutional crap???  Once again, Scottish nationalism, despite claiming to be modern, is just about harking back to the past
If they left to live, work and start a family elsewhere then they obviously don't care that much about the constitutional arrangements of a country they left at all then, do they?
yes they do. People really need to fuck off with the idea that going somewhere outwith Scotland (that isn't even crossing an international boundary) means you lose contact with whats going on at home.  When I was living and working in England I kept up to date with the political goings on (run up to indyref1) and I visited friends and family in Scotland every couple of month.  The 'once you've stepped out of Scotland you've forsaken Scotland' rhetoric from the nats is as bad as the worst forms of ethnic nationalism.
Going to England on holiday is not the same thing as leaving Scotland to live and work elsewhere. 
yes cos i wanted this union that's based on some old dudes making a pretty penny for themselves,  That's why the Union is still broken it's never changed, even after 300 years
I don't think they've betrayed Scotland, nor have I said anything about even supporting an independent Scotland - i'm just stating my opinion on who should be given the right to vote in Indyref 2.0 if/when it happens.    
Nope  The Scottish people are those who live in the country and contribute to it, if you've left you're just an expat and therefore have absolutely no right to a say in how the country is run
Well i live in Canada due to UK immigration laws on non-eu spouses. Do i not get a say because Theresa May priced 48% of UK fulltime workers out of sponsoring a non-eu spouse?  
No, you don't get a say because you don't live here. Same as I don't get a say in how Canada is run.
I'm Canadian, and *could* still vote in Canadian elections (I believe), but I wouldn't even consider it, as I don't live there. 
And I guess you also don't WANT to live there?
If I wanted to live there, I wouldn't live here. :)
Well it makes sense you wouldn't vote in Canadian elections as you have no vested interest. I have vested interest in UK politics even though I reside in Canada right now.
Well, I hope, once Scotland is independent, that you and your family can move here much more easily. Until then, however, I am still of the opinion that after a certain number of years away (I'd say maybe 5), you should no longer be allowed to vote. 
I think if you retain your Citizenship you should always be allowed to vote, if you adopt another country's then no vote. That's my opinion.
Technically if you're gone five years (or you are gone less but don't intend to return within five years) you're not supposed to vote. But voting abroad as a Canuck is all kinds of weirdness.  I don't do it, especially as I can vote here. But apparently it's quite annoying; I looked into it in the last election. My old riding is Trudeau's though, so I didn't feel too bad about costing him one vote.
I also don't get a say how Canada runs as I'm not a citizen.
Is it difficult to become a Canadian citizen? I imagine that must be an easier solution than finding high paid work in the UK?
Im a perm resident now so I can live and work. I just can't vote. We both want to live in Scotland.
Ah, I see. Well I think your best shot might be hoping we vote for independence. Shitty situation though, you have my sympathy.
Cheers, Yeh it sucks. Trying to develop the skills of be offered a job in Scotland earning the sponsorship minimum. Target is within 2yrs.
Best of luck.
I've heard no really sensible reason for letting ex-pats vote. I wouldn't let them vote on library opening times or bin collection day, why should they get a say in this? They literally don't live here.  Obviously there are codicils - members of the military or students on placement etc. But permanent ex-pats? Swivel.
> So are they going to lower the age of people who can vote even further  Lowering the voting age to 16 had been SNP policy for a long time, it wasn't some cunning ploy to help the Yes vote in the indyref (in fact it hurt it, and they knew this, because the SNP can read the same polls you and me can).
> This time it should be open to all Scottish people, whether they live in Scotland or not. You want the Scottish people to be heard?  Not based on ethnicity, no, I don't.
It's not like the younger generation have to spend longer living with the results of the decision, or anything.
Irrelevant. Everyone has the right to vote, and being in your 60s or 70s doesn't mean your vote doesn't count.
Now that's an interesting thing to say, because you...  > So are they going to lower the age of people who can vote even further to try and cancel out the votes from those terrible older people who voted no  > That was a quick generation, eh?  ...seem to be of the belief that young people are only being allowed to vote in an attempt to counteract another voting block. Which isn't true; people aren't saying the older generation shouldn't be allowed a vote, they're saying that the younger generation should be allowed a vote.
[removed]
What a horrible thing to say, why should a group in society be disenfranchised just cause they have different political views to yourself?
That was an exaggerated comment in response to the previous comment saying old people were incapable of making their own decisions.   
That's the spirit, that's how democracy works! Vote the same way as me or go die! Still, at least the country isn't going to be divided (again) by this. Go Nicola!
I was responding in response to your quip about terrible older people who can't make decisions for themselves, as an over exaggeration. Well spotted.   The country will be divided no matter what. Scotland didn't vote for Brexit, so either we're in the UK and out of Europe which half of us don't want or we are out the UK which the other half don't want.
Scotland is out of the EU with or without independence. Scotland won't get a guard of honour and a warm welcome back into the EU as an independent country.   This will only serve to further divide the country, just like it did last time when people embarrassed themselves (on both sides) after the votes were counted.
> Scotland won't get a guard of honour and a warm welcome back into the EU as an independent country  Why not? It already meets all the criteria and the semi-official line is that so long as the split isn't entirely hostile then there's no reason it wouldn't be an easier arrangement than Brexit itself. No EU country has expressed any issue with it, even Spain is on board.
Being in the EU requires responsible finances. With the state of oil and with how big the proposed budget gap was last referendum, it will be much larger, Europe will impose cuts if we want a chance in hell at joining. The SNP won't mention that though, the SNP got popular from excessive spending and good social policies. If Scotland gains independence the SNP will jump ship before they can catch the flak for the inevitable shitstorm we would immediately face.   We have to re-apply, no matter what. 
>Vote the same way as me or go die!  That reminds me of one of the tragic cities in [Kino's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino%27s_Journey). [The last person alive because of this system ended up committing suicide :(](/spoiler)

> possibly hard right in Germany  That's not looking likely right now (still six months away from the election). Since Schultz was announced for the SPD, the CDU/CSU has been pegged back and the AfD, where it was polling consistently around the low-to-mid-tens until the beginning of the year, is now bobbling in and out of double digits.  If the CDU/CSU were flirting with a harder right, a continued SPD surge would make them think twice.
[deleted]
True, any idea of the impossible has been obliterated over the past year, but there still appears to be less appetite for the far/hard/alt right than here or the US. Emphasis on appears. Who knows what's going to crawl out over the next six months.
You forgot Russia. Divide and rule is the oldest trick in the book. I just feel sorry for the poor fuckers whose job it will be to go through Willie Rennie's emails.
She could let Scotland stay in the single market, she wanted all the UK to stay in the first place, and there would be no reason for another referendum for a long time. Would be a baller move by May
Want independence bad like but no way is it happening
Right now, I'm still a no. I understand the impulse. England is moving further and further to the right, that's terrifying in a lot of ways. However, Europe is also drifting right and leaving the UK in order to remain in the EU simply may not protect us from the rise of the populist right around the world.  We don't need in or out, we need a credible united fight back by the political left. 
Despite all the ukippers BS, there's actually very little a "right wing" EU could do to affect an individual nation states. A right wing tory government can, and does, a whole lot.
Yeah. I never really got the 'neoliberal' accusations towards the EU. It does facilitate free trade, and the currency union sure does push towards that, but the EU itself isn't pushing for some sort of oligarchy. Also worth remembering that the 'right' in many European countries are still to the left of our right-wing parties on many issues. Merkel is part of the CDU but still backed her open refugee policy for example.
For fucks sake, does she not realise independence sentiment is at a low and that we will be in a far worse position economically than if we were in the UK? 
> For fucks sake, does she not realise independence sentiment is at a low  Based on what? The multiple polls from last month showing it at the all time high of 50/50 split?
Same polling companies that said Brexit would be unanimous remain victory? 
Apart from they didnt..
Yes they did...The entire thing before Brexit was that people grew comfortable with a remain vote winning. So much so the GBP grew to it's highest against the USD in years the night of Brexit before the results came in reference:  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-poll-brexit-remain-vote-leave-live-latest-who-will-win-results-populus-a7097261.html  
The actual poll of polls says different..including two polls that favoured leave the day before https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/  16 of 31 polls in June were in favour of leave, and one tied
Your source did just highlight the fundamental flaw of polls. They are useless for finding out what the results actually will be. I mean just look at how indecisive it is for the months leading up. I guess we won't see how they result until closer to the vote but I think it's correct that the current 50/50 split will continue throughout.
But polls aren't a prediction they are just a snap shot at that time. They aren't flawed as they aren't designed to find the result of a vote, just the view of people at that point in time.
If polls were the exact truth we might as well skip the referendum altogether
The problem with polls is that they only canvas the opinions of people who do opinion polls
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/13/half-scots-do-not-back-second-independence-referendum-brexit/amp/
> Asked if there should be another referendum before Brexit happens, 49 per cent said no, 39 per cent said yes and 13 per cent were unsure.  The question was on the timing of the poll, not whether to have one or not. 
The question was whether we should have a second referendum before Brexit negotiations are over; very different from polling support for independence or support for having a referendum at all. The polls on independence show that the yes vote has been steadily gaining ground.
> independence sentiment is at a low  > Half do not back it  Considering it was at around 30% when the first was announced, I wasn't aware 50 was lower than 30.
This is why I hate this sub, I support yes but the fucking idiots on here just defy logic and won't listen to anything that goes against their delusions, when we lose again I won't even fucking care cause it'll mean cunts like you are sad
What are you even fucking talking about?
so she should put her political ambitions, before her First Minister duties of securing the best deal for scotland.
She's been told there will not be a special deal for Scotland. She tried, and May rebuffed her..leaving only one option. 
We should change our name to Nissanland. Sure we can work something out then.
Her duty should be to do what is best for Scotland and it is obvious that this is not the time for such a thing. We will not be allowed to stay in the EU, we have been told. 
so when is the best time?, in 10 years time when the tory austerity continues, labour are just maybe begining to gain traction but still a long way of being in charge, we are out of the EU, the free market?
The best time is when we know we would be economically secure which is far from our current reality. We are not getting back in to the single market. 
> We are not getting back in to the single market.  Indeed, Scotland will simply avoid leaving it.
My mistake, I meant to say that we will not be remaining in the single market. We have been told this already.   https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/no-circumstances-scotland-stays-eu-independent-not/amp/
again tory graph
Ah yes because the source means the facts they report have no meaning. 
mainstream media can't be trusted in issues such as this, I think when you look what's happened the world over at the momment I thnik we can both agree that some of the deciisions people have made is due to mainstream media being biased one way or another  the best thing to do is too look at everything and decide from that, citing one source from a pro UK anti Scotland newspaper ain't going to help your case here
Says David Mundell, clearly an unbiased source here.  It's nonsense, and everyone knows it. Scotland would be able to “re”join the EU. There are no great obstacles; in fact, it would be much easier than most EU accessions.
What incentive is there for a Westminster government to make it easy for Scotland to be 'economically secure' if we'd just leave after getting there?
we will never be under tory rule
Her belief is that it would be best for Scotland so that's why she is doing ?  If the majority of people did not want another referendum then they shouldn't have voted for the SNP.
The SNP don't have a majority government though?
doesnt matter, greens fully support this
I'm not denying that, the op implied that the majority of people voted for the SNP which is what was wrong.
true but they voted for parties that did, i think what he meant was, if people didn't want this to happen they could have voted Labour or god forbit Tory *shudder*
It's actual name is the Ruth Davidson for a Strong Opposition Party.
no it's Ruth Davidson for a strong Ruth Davidson party, now all they have voted for is for her to get a job in London
>greens   LOL
why lol they give us the majority
Because greens are a complete joke of a party 
and yet here they are holding balance of power in Scotland
That's not saying much, the Scottish Parliament system was designed to make it effectively impossible to have a majority government. The fact one happened was an anomaly. Majority governments in Parliamentary systems are a bug, not a feature. The executive shouldn't have effective control of the legislature as it weakens its role as a check on the Executive's power. That's one of the many things wrong with how HM Parliament is set up.
They got more constituency votes than they did last time, when they did get a majority. It's just the system is so convoluted..trying to stop the SNP getting a majority. 
They still won enough seats in order to function as a minority government without a coalition with another party. They are officially in power and drive the policy making it Scotland - yes, it means that they have a harder time getting their changes through but the sentiment is still the same.
Her beliefs are objectively wrong then, this is not the time for as big a shake up as independence.   And there are plenty of SNP supporters who aren't nationalists, the reason for this is because of their populist social policies. They have a good reputation of treating the Scottish people well but we simply cannot sustain such policies outside of the UK. 
Exactly, once I hear a convincing economic argument I will consider independence but no matter what taxes will have to go up and there will have to be cuts which I'm totally against.
Right because the Tory government at Westminster is handing out tax cuts to the masses.... 
Because they have to deal with the reality of actually running a country instead of being handed a wad of cash every year and blaming every setback on those that hand it to them.
No they blame it on europe, immigrants and immigration instead
Not saying I support them. Just that the SNP don't have the same responsibilites and can therefore get away with more.
Again, that's your opinion (and of others, I don't contend this). Some believe it is the right time, and there are some who believe it is always the right time (rightly or wrongly).  The overarching policy and mindset of the SNP is to push through Scottish independence... those who do not want independence had to weigh there options... do they want to vote for the SNP as they favour their policies, with the risk of another referendum or do they want to vote for someone else to ensure absolutely no chance of an indyref 2.0 but with less favourable policies.   It was clear the SNP would go for another referendum.. you can't vote for them then get mad about it, it's insanity.
>It was clear the SNP would go for another referendum.. you can't vote for them then get mad about it, it's insanity.  After a generation. 4 years is not a generation no matter who you ask. People have every right to get mad at a second referendum as we were told it would not happen for at least another generation by the party leader. 
Or if a material change in Scotlands circumstances had happened (which was clearly written in due to the upcoming brexit vote)... it was so bloody obvious, it was spoken about by every media outlet, political commentators, in joke panel shows - it wasn't a secret.
we have been told no such thing
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/no-circumstances-scotland-stays-eu-independent-not/amp/
you have cited a story from the Tory graph, seriously, come back to me when you have something from a credable source
So you're going to just discount the source because they have different views from you? How close minded of you. 
All the same arguments used for leaving the EU will now be attacked by Leavers in the case of Scotland. All the arguments used for remaining in the EU will be attacked by Remainers. "But it's clearly different" they will cry, while accusing opponents on all sides of being idiots for different reasons. We live in a world where only Yes and Brexit or No and Remain make any sense. Or do they? It's beyond Kafka, but unfortunately it isn't funny. It isn't funny at all. 
Calling it now: if a referendum occurs (and I really hope it does), interference from Westminster will cause the wording of the question on the ballot to be such that the answers will be swapped from the last time (so that "no" means "leave the UK" and "yes" means to stay).  Keep on your toes.
Vote No, voted yes last time, the "once in a generation" vote. Scotland had its chance, SNP has had its chance to run a country rather than a constant campaign for independence. SNP have endangered the schools and particularly pregnant women who must now travel over 100miles to give birth in hospital. Only two places matter to SNP politics, Glasgow and Edinburgh, Aberdeen matters when the money slows down, Inverness matters when the tourism dips. The far north doesn't exist (Wick Thurso etc) and the islands (Orkney Shetland) want to be independent themselves. Breaking Scotland from the UK would only be the beginning of the end for Scotland.
The fact that there seems to be no possibility of being an independent country with no plans to rejoin the EU means I simply cannot vote in favour of independence.  UK isn't perfect but the EU is an absolute mess and we're better off out of it.
Nothing is set in stone yet. You don't have to vote based on now. As a nation we will hopefully weigh the pros and cons at the time and make an educated decision in what is best for the country.
She has no authority to bring about a second referendum and such reckless beahviour is merely holding the UK hostage. So, no chance in hell of Westminster accepting it.
Reckless behaviour  From a BREXIT voter  LOL
not only that but he's ignoriing the mandate given
Dear Vladimir Putin  Can you please fix this election for us?Just like you did for the U.S(Lolz). The poor Scottish people really need more "Freedom"!  P.S Why didn't you do it last time?!
[They tried](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/754332/russia-spies-scotland-independence-referendum-aid-snp-claims-security-expert) then they tried to undermine [the result](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/russia-calls-foul-scottish-referendum).
If Scottish labia weren't so useless they could use this to our advantage.
Tbh i'd love to see just about anyone bring this up with Davidson. The free ride is over and she can't scarper every awkward question. 
She'll just turn around and run away.
Stealing Cameron’s tactics.
Andy? Stealing his look as well. 
The free ride is just beginning, she is golden girl in the rest of the UK right now. They've replaced one leader built into having widespread approval through a complete lack of media scrutiny and focused on a sole constitutional issue with another and none of them seem to have noticed.
I really hope you are wrong.
Not sure if you meant labia or labour...
Labia is the Scottish version of labour.

Oh my God, her face at the end! 
Best part was the same day their communications director Alan Roden described the party as "unflappable", and this was pointed out by [Kezia's dad](https://twitter.com/jefforbited/status/868883020236951556)!
Portillo was saying Davidson was tge only proven Tory winner (implying the only real potential new leader when may goes.  In the wake of grenfel this could be the mud which, when slung, slips up her career ambitions.
May tried to campaign on a single issue and got sidetracked by actually having to defend policies.  Davidson campaigned on a single issue and Scots Lab, and Scot's Lib Dem backed her up on that.  When Davidson has to defend Tory policy she will be off in a huff. 
She couldnt make it to leader with this disaster looming in the background. That was me point
Your point wasn't wrong.  I wasn't arguing. 
Good.
How?  I can't see SNP bad in there anywhere...
Everything the tories do is somehow the snp's fault.
It is not new news that the Tories are cunts 
That's why it's saddening that Tories stayed in power thanks to Scottish votes. Scots could have turned this country back into the right direction (with SNP/Labour government), instead they pressed the accelerator and everything's going to get progressively worse.
77% of Scottish voters rejected the Tories' prospectus for government, by far the highest of the four UK home nations (Wales: 33.6% Tory; Eng: 45.6% Tory; NI: 36% DUP vs Sco: 28.6% Tory). The Tories stayed in power largely due to their very strong performance in England at not far off half the vote. It is not Scotland's duty to provide unanimously left wing politicians to make up for the Tories strong showing elsewhere, don't be fucking daft.
Did they fuck, they stayed in power because the south of England voted them back in en masse.  You can ram that narrative up your arse.
Not me, matey, I did my bit.
[Yeah, unfortunately...](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/pa-31622648.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all)  Probably doesn't help that the votes are all being counted by a private company owned by, wait for it, a fucking tory scumbag.
I'm specifically ashamed of my area where the same grinning, chinless, Tory wankers get voted back in time after time. I can see it's difficult for people who do like their local MP but I wish they would think a little more about... well, every fucker else in the country!
Tories have 317 seats 13 of which were provided by Scotland 11 from Wales and the rest from England er go its Scotland's fault?  Fuck off.
Those 11 votes were swinged from SNP. You do realise that, right?
i do. However if you look at the break down apparently the vote went SNP >> Labour >> Tory   All on a campain of muh union.   Regardless it is not our responsibility or obligation to save England from its self. How about you go do something about it where it matters rather than bitching about what Scotland does or does not do.  Edit i mean use your fucking head when the snp have all but 3 seats do you honestly think its going to be a swing from labour.
I know it's not our responsibility. It did however happen at our hands. SNP + Labour could have been a thing. Instead we have Tories + DUP. In Polish, DUPa means ass. Quite relevant.
that is an issue for labour again NOT scotland  tel me why the fuck should i vote for an incompetant party thats done fuck all but in fight since corbyrn came into power because YOU want me to. Or because i will be blamed for how the result turns out Else where.  but as this seems to be your reasoining. My seat did not flip er go i did my part.
Fuck up, we didn't have Tory voter we have unionist voters. They aren't the same. Also, maybe the English should sort themselves out. We already know the Tories are cunts, go and explain that to everyone south of Liverpool 
It's still an 'x' for the Tories on the ballot paper, regardless of the reasons behind it.
..and still the same shitey Tory policies. :/
Aye but murdering someone who raped your granny isn't the same as murdering your granny
Yeah, the majority or tory voters in Scotland didn't do it because of the SNP, they did it cause scottish labour don't provide any sort of opposition. 
[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/6hzlkj/kezia_dugdales_team_cheer_the_election_of_tory_mps/) seems relevant here  
They really seem to have lost all concept of what they're trying to achieve. 
Except for London.  We've almost eradicated the Tories here.
Surely not that nice cuddley woman from the Ruth Davidson Party?

It should surprise no one. They act and have always acted in the interests of the moneyed classes. That they get some ordinary working class Scots voting for them is the mystery - they can't *all* be as thick as mince, can they?    
They can and they are.
I used to think your view was poisonous cynism.  My views have changed a lot over time.  If you meet one or two people who will defend the empty guff by simply repeating it, slowly, loudly and very angrily, you can say "ah well, there's bound to be a few daft cunts, right?"  Once you've met dozens of them, that starts to become hard to maintain. They're a _demographic_, as much as that saddens me.
They are thick enough to think that agreeing with the Tories will help them climb the ladder to the upperclasses with them.
Hijacking this source post to add a more direct official source for those who'd like to see it: [Meeting of the parliament, Wednesday 25 June 2014](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=9285&mode=pdf) - PDF and the results of the vote are on pages 84-85. A number of amendments were considered that day but most notable was amendment 38, a Conservative attempt to stop the abolition of right-to-buy. That vote goes along exactly the same lines as the final vote, which to me shows rather clearly their motivation in the final vote.
Nope.  The right to buy part had already been settled earlier in the debate.   There were a number of amendments to the bill debated and voted on before the bill was passed.   One of those amendments was raised by the Tories and was specifically regarding the right to buy.   After the debate there was a vote on the Tory amendment which the Tories lost.   Later on after all the debates and votes on all the other proposed amendments to the bill had been concluded there was a final vote on whether to pass the bill.   That was when the Tories still voted against the bill in its entirety even although their amendment about right to buy had earlier been raised, debated, voted on and settled.    
But if you are against the abolition of the right to buy, and that is the red line, then you vote against the bill in full, even if your amendment is defeated.    The motivation simply doesn't stop just because your amendment failed.  Otherwise every vote would have unanimous ayes.
This was exactly what I was saying. I'm not sure how you understood it differently. Perhaps I worded it badly. Essentially what I was trying to suggest was that, in the end, it was the Conservatives' objection to the abolition of right to buy that motivated their 'against' vote in the end.
Is there no International building code requirements? It's 2017 and you still need to pass laws on building codes? 
There is an "International Building Code". Enforcement is at issue. And cost. It would be beyond reason to try to bring every structure "up to code", but life safety issues are another matter entirely and deserve the attention of a government that governs for the people.
There are codes, but usually these mean that __new__ buildings need to be designed to the current codes.  Old buildings, of which there are lots in the UK, don't get upgraded unless there are significant changes.  e.g. My local pub, back when I lived in Edinburgh was built in 1400 or so.  Sure it was updated, to add running water, electricity, etc, but it's never going to be "current".
It gets tricky when a building is older than America and a listed building protected by law as a piece of national heritage. It doesnt help hat these tend to be built from solid stone and. It brick so things like wiring and piping cannot be internal to the walls 
Shock fucking horror
That's a bit awkward!
What were their reasons to oppose this legislation?
>What were their reasons to oppose this legislation?  If you look at the amendments the Tories proposed to the bill, their objections were to the ending of right to buy and changes to preferential allocation of social housing:  http://www.parliament.scot/S4_Bills/Housing%20(Scotland)%20Bill/b41as4-stage3-g.pdf  They don't seem to have proposed any amendments to the safety aspects of the bill.
That argument holds no weight as all the amendments, including the Tory proposed amendment to right to buy, had been debated and voted on earlier in the debate.   That meant that the right to buy part had already been raised, debated, voted on and settled.  Despite this the Tories were still the only ones to vote against passing the bill at the end of the debate. 
I don't quite see why, *The Tories were so convinced of the absolute necessity of depleting public housing stock that they felt it was absolutely essential to vote against making housing safer* is a winning argument, myself.  But then, maybe that's me.
Waste of time creating legislation that will never be enforced properly.
What does improve safety mean ,  sounds like playing to the mob  
Two seconds on google brings up the [2014 Housing Act](https://www.landlords.org.uk/sites/default/files/housingscotland2014.pdf).  Part three on *repairing standard* might be what you're looking for and has a focus on carbon monoxide detection and electrical safety. Not really playing to the mob but something that genuinely adds safety to privately owned properties for rent.
> Part three on repairing standard might be what you're looking for and has a focus on carbon monoxide detection and electrical safety. Not really playing to the mob but something that genuinely adds safety to privately owned properties for rent.  Whilst the Tories voted against the bill, the list of amendments they proposed shows which parts they wanted changed:  http://www.parliament.scot/S4_Bills/Housing%20(Scotland)%20Bill/b41as4-stage3-g.pdf  Their opposition seems to have been to the ending of right to buy and changes to preferential allocation of social housing, rather than to any of the safety legislation.
Interesting, in order to do this did they have to oppose the whole bill or just suggest amendments?
You have played this defence further up as well.   This is not a get out jail free card.   This means that they prioritised those other things over safety. It sounds vaguely like they could be accused of having prioritised ideological opposition to social housing over safety of the residents.   
>This means that they prioritised those other things over safety.  Not really. The bill passed. It was clear that every other party was going to vote in favour. The Tories voting against wasn't going to make any difference to the implementation of the fire safety provisions.  You could equally ask why fire safety legislation was tacked on to the ending of right to buy. In England the fire rules were introduced separately and came into force a couple of months earlier.  This is all just political point scoring. It didn't have any effect on the passing of the legislation.
>[This means that they prioritised those other things over safety.] Not really. The bill passed.  Yes, really :-). They wanted the bill to fail. That's why they voted against it?
But that is standard in England going back to 2002, boilers have to be tested , smoke alarms have to be installed etc.  The worst bloody culprits I have seen with regards to electrical safety (if you take tenants out of the equation)are bloody councils
Specifically regarding carbon monoxide, it looks like changes to the same effect only took place in 2015 in the [he Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1693/pdfs/uksi_20151693_en.pdf) a whole year after the Scottish Government first did. Apart from that however, I think the main story here isn't regulations in Scotland vs England but rather that 12 tories, including Ruth Davidson, voted against measures to be put in place to save lives.  Edit: /u/WhiteSatanicMills has pointed out that the timelines for each country are actually fairly close to each other for implementing these changes, doesn't change the main point of the bill not being a catch up to 2002, but important to mention nonetheless.
>Specifically regarding carbon monoxide, it looks like changes to the same effect only took place in 2015 in the he Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 a whole year after the Scottish Government first did.   I don't think that timeline fits at all. The Scottish bill was introduced on 22 November 2013:  http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/70102.aspx  The bill went through the Scottish parliament and received royal assent in August 2014. However, the provisions on smoke alarms etc didn't come into effect until 1 December 2015:  https://www.fifedirect.org.uk/topics/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&p2sid=BED466B5-B04C-625C-5B55E15236CBD159&themeid=AABDB2B9-D379-434F-98CA-AF2B73303854  In England the timeline was almost identical. The government proposed an investigation into changes on 20 November 2013, 2 days before the Scottish parliament act was introduced:  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-review-policy-on-smoke-and-carbon-monoxide-alarms  The changes were announced in early 2015, implemented September 2015 and went into force 1 October 2015: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1693/pdfs/uksi_20151693_en.pdf  Whilst they were implemented first in England, I don't think it's reasonable to consider either England or Scotland as "first". By the almost identical dates when the changes were first proposed, I think this was the result of an advisory report which was implemented by both governments at the same time. 
Ah, my mistake then. That's not really the main point of that reply though, in terms of timelines it's more in response to the comment of this being a standard in England since 2002 - both your comment and mine shows that it is a fairly recent change in both Governments.
What have the councils got to do with anything? Everything is run by Housing Associations now. 
Same shite, different name
Kinda aye kinda no. The council's still take the blame for shit they've fuck all to do with. I'm all for giving councils shit when they deserve it, but all that does is let housing associations get away with being cunts.
They're "arms length organisations" spun out by councils so that they can shrug and go "not our problem". It's part of the bullshit obfuscation of responsibility that makes politics so wonderful. Central government takes things and makes them local governments problem to solve, local government then takes things and makes them the problem of an arms length organisation and they then subcontract and the whole game goes on with no one actually really accountable for any shite. It's going to be the same song and dance when it comes to them unravelling the Grenfell mess.
>The worst bloody culprits I have seen with regards to electrical safety (if you take tenants out of the equation)are bloody councils  100% correct
it says in the link improved smoke alarms, CO2 detectors and heat sensors. So sounds about right 
#lets get ready to ruuuuuumble!
##**Let'sssssss get readddddyyyyyyyyy to sit back and see what government rUK decides for usssssssssss!!**
[deleted]
That's a losing mentality whether you realise it or not.
Can you actually see the glaring flaw in your logic?  
[deleted]
Well if people are voting for a party they don't support because they are the ones that 'win' due to the rUK then rUK had decided your vote and has still decided the government.  You are saying, if you don't like that the rUK decides elections for you, you should simply vote for the party which they vote for, so you can sort of notionally pretend that it was your choice.  My post was highlighting the fact that despite Scotland not majority supporting Tory, it recieves Tory governments, the rest of the UK deciding the Government Scotland is ruled by. You suggest that changing your vote to help back the government the rest of the UK votes for, means that they don't control the government that is elected?
Couldn't one also vote for another party which competes against the Tories, but which would actually expand outside of Scotland and put them in some danger of losing? If, for example, the Lib Dems or the Greens swept all but 3 seats in London they probably wouldn't stop at the GLA's border and pout about how powerless they are.
Yeah you could tactfully vote for a party which you support less, to help get something more favourable. But again, England has chosen the government for Scotland.  Say all the SNP voters switched to Labour in order to stop a Tory government. First of all this would be in effective. It would not gurantee a Labour victory. Secondly, the issue would still remain, the majority of the Scottish people would be governed and lent their support to a party they did not support in order to accommodate England. It's still a government by England's consent if a bit of a lesser of evils compared to the Torys.   And that's assuming the SNP voters homogenously saw Labour as the lesser of evils. Which would never be the case.
The issue I take with this is that it's always true in a democracy; if you don't compromise and side with a party other people will vote for you'll get nothing. There's nothing unique about either the UK or Scotland in this regard.   There's obviously a vacancy for a better opposition party, and if any other party had seen a victory like the SNP's they'd be gearing up to sweep the whole UK. It would be entirely possible to support a party with the SNP's policies (though with independence replaced with federalism) but which actually tried to win a majority.
It doesn't necessarily have to be the case (or at least it can be mitigated to a large extent) when you have an Alternative Vote system or proportional representation.  And sure on a personal basis you may have to compromise. You won't find any party which you agree 100% with, but when you are talking about huge swathes of the population there is an issue - and that is an issue in rUK.  The party Scotland majority favours is not the Government rUK wants. Scotland has voted the SNP yet if they ran across all of the UK they would not be elected because people don't support many of the SNP's policies. England has a track record of supporting the Torys. If the SNP changed their policies and basically became 'not Tony or Corby progressive party' they would A. Not be the party Scotland supports if they want to get anywhere and B. Still not be elected a lot of the time.  My take is as follows: You are arguing that Scotland should take its lumps. It's part of a bigger democracy, you should compromise some of your views in order to remain a part of the UK and receive such benefits and accept that your role in the larger nation and say in the larger nation is diminished.  I'm saying that there is no need to compromise. The trade off for having a diminished role for the large nation is not worth while. In fact I think Scotland would be better off without it.     
Sorry but complaining that Scotland receives a Tory government when it actually votes majority SNP and pretending like that is some sort of injustice is entirely against the idea of a democracy, where the majority wins. A society where the few (Scotland) decided the governing body for the many (the UK) is not a democracy.

A society where the few (Scotland) decided the governing body for the many (the UK) is not a democracy.   Well if you are claiming that democracy is "where the majority wins", then you have a contridiction in your argument because the conservative party did not win a majority of the vote in the UK.  The definition of democracy is variable. Fact is democracy can come in many sizes. You could have a UK wide democracy, a European sized democracy, or a Scottish sized democracy.  Considering Scotland as a nation has consistently voted against Tory governments and has yet been subjected to them year after year, makes the idea a Scotland sized democracy will result in more people being ruled by a government which they support. In turn it makes it marginally less likely England will be ruled by a government it did not support. Are you going to argue that is 'less' democratic?

Katie Hopkins. Reality tv "star" and paid hack for the fuckin' Sun and daily mail. Maybe we should just ignore her because I can't believe she has anything constructive to add to any sensible or rational conversation. 
That's a valid point.  I dunno what this whole "going to speak in schools" thing is though. I don't want to thought police it, but surely they can find a better guest speaker. 
I'm in the same position. I don't agree with no-platforming speakers but when it comes to school children it's a bit of a grey area. Modern Studies for example is taught as neutrally as possible to allow the pupil to make up their own mind about issues, with the facts at hand. Hopkins doesn't strike me as the impartial type.

The thing that annoys me about this most is the difference between free speech and captive audience.   If Katie Hopkins wants to hold a meeting or give a talk and all her supporters turn up and listen then I don't think there should be anything to prevent that. She's exercising her free speech and most people are exercising their freedom to ignore the fuck out of her.   When you bring her into a schools then the kids are forced to listen to her moronic, hateful ramblings. Furthermore if it's the school bussing her in then it legitimises her message to the children. Instead of perhaps an alternative voice they're going to be presented with an idiot in a posh accent as legitimate source of political and social theory. 
> What could she possibly say to a child human that will positively impact their life in any way?  "I'm going to rip out my own tongue and cut off all my fingers" 
My sole regret is that she has but one tongue and ten fingers to sacrifice to that cause.
I'm out of the loop here - she's been talking in schools?  What lunatic headperson would endorse that?  The absolute best that could be said for her is that she voices her opinions without fear and it's made her 'famous' and a lot of money. (she's a vile hag, but I try to imagine what her mother would say)  But then, since the mid 80s our society and education system seems to have been promoting the idea that 'being famous for being famous' is a worthy goal to base your life on.
> she's been talking in schools?  What lunatic headperson would endorse that?  I don't know why it's happening up here, but the Free Schools and Academies policy down south pretty much guarantees that this will happen.  What kind of rich person is prepared to put their own money into running a school and educating other people's children?  Perhaps a rich person with *strong opinions*, who wants those opinions spread.  Fundamentalist Christians, extreme Muslims, even Scientologists (though their front group "Applied Scholastics") will all try to get in on the educative action, if they haven't already... oh, [they have.](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/revealed-how-thousands-of-london-children-are-exposed-to-scientology-group-in-schools-a3433041.html)  Since the Free Schools policy was designed by Gove to give Rupert Murdoch an entry point to the UK education system (his education company already holds sway over a worrying proportion of US schools), others will flow in to the education arena by the same built-in back-door.  Gove seemed wholly clueless about this likelihood, or perhaps just doesn't give a fuck. 
>modern studies is taught as neutrally as possible  Wish we had that at my school lol
> Modern Studies for example is taught as neutrally as possible  Heheh, not the way I was taught it, but I'll always be grateful for the strong pro-trade union (particularly NUT, naturally) stance my teachers took.  They weren't shy about sharing their personal opinions on pretty much everything we studied, and I'm glad of that.
She probably knew fine well she didn'y have a chance of getting into any schools, and only did it so she can pull the "censorship" card.
Yeah, she's trying her best to stay relevant as now she's been stripped of her article and radio show, she just another piece of shit screeching right wing garbage on twitter.  This is the closest she's come to being talked about since she got canned, maybe we should ignore this shit and let her go back to tweeting. Noones going to let her talk to kids anyway 
She's got to have issues right? She's famous for being a twat, that's it, she's done fuck all else.   Imagine you're on your death bed and the thought that springs to mind is my whole life is built on the world hating me and me saying things to piss people off.  Fuck that. 
Hopkins should be put up against the wall
And given a damn good rogering?    On second thoughts definitely not. 
Maybe against a gate in a field tho? 
Didn't she once have a job with A4E, back when they were Government approved rather than being recognised as scammers, where she toured job centres and harangued hapless jobseekers?  Imagine being unemployed, short of cash, struggling, your life at a low ebb, and then *that* appears in front of you to offer encouragement and guidance.  A judgemental gobshite *entrepreneur* who felt free to turn down the only real job she was ever offered *on national telly.*
Wow, that's embarrassing. Still, it's an easy mistake to make  I don't suppose he's the first person to assume she cares at all about educating anybody.

For all intensive purposes it doesn't make much difference
Ooft, hahaha. Sare yin.  Edit: I just posted a god-tier put down about her that was in the Guardian so I'll repost here for anyone interested:  [Parents beware: is Katie Hopkins hanging around your child's school?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/sep/28/katie-hopkins-stand-strong-school-tour-parents-beware)
She might be right, her breath might be so rank and fishy it counts as baited.
What comes out of her mouth certainly is.
presumably Harry Potter is about the limits of Katie's reading level.
Unless there's a pop-up version of Mein Kampf.
You're a bit optimistic, aren't you?
I was referencing that JK Rowling uses the phrase "baited breath" incorrectly as well
Can't really blame her, we've all gotten peckish on a fishing trip before.
Does she? Well, bugger me.
Do I have to?
Can anyone confirm if Katie Hopkins sends her kids to boarding school? 
Fuck! Who let Katie Hopkins breed?
He mastered the bated debate like a master.
Rolling out some SAAS, surely..?
Yasssss queen slay!
What a fuckin' mong.
In Katie Hopkins' case, I'm fairly sure it would at least smell baited

That picture is the most american thing i've ever seen.
But he's 1/128th Scottish and spent 3 days vacation in Edinboro. 
His ancestor was born in a mash tun escaping the Glencoe Massacre. 100% true he knows because his uncle told him.
I would put money on that boy being American, Canadian at least. Unless he was on his way to a Bay City Rollers concert of course.
Americans dig deep and tell tall tales for their Irish Heritage. Canadians do it for their Ukrainian or Scottish.
American here. I'd just like to correct you by saying that it doesn't have to be Irish, any well known country will do. Especially if it's European. Bonus points for being at least 1/16 Native American.

But up until the last second, you thought it might not be a disappointment. That's our jam.
Well, that's because Sweden's neighbours, Denmark, Norway (Maybe Finland - no-one knows) upvotes their brothers.  What do the English and Irish redditors do to Scottish content in their feed?

Explain please. I've not come across NP links before? I see it means No Participation. 
Any up/downvotes wont be counted unless they remove NP from the link.
It does count them, but certain subs will hide the up/downvote buttons with CSS when you use an NP link. And if you have RES you get a little warning whenever you do vote and the option to revert it. It's not an official reddit mechanic though, so nobody actually knows if you're voting on NP links. I think they should incorporate it though, partly to stop brigading but mostly because I fucking hate reading complaints about brigades.
A lot of subs will remove your link unless it has the no prefix to stop brigading.
Ah good point. I did not consider that as I was just trying to be funny  
I'm in. I'll share the thread. If this goes viral the postman is going to be raging. We'll have to do something for Britain's most perturbed post man next year.

They don't call it going postal for nothing!
POST CODE ERROR  Sorry to hijack these comments but the address has an error.  ZE2 9A**R** NOT ZE2 9A**S**  Being nosey I used Google Maps to check out the area. ZE2 9AR errored with a Not Found.  Wouldn't want a lorry load of post to end up nowhere :-(
There's only 65 people on the island. The postie will know each of them by name. Plus, there's only one school. I'm fairly certain you could just put "Aron: Skerries, Scotland" and it would make it to him. 
"That wee boy on that island they're all talking about, Scotland" might work too.
That'd do it! 
I laughed too hard at this.
This is probably true. In the good old days before Royal Mail was privatised, letters addressed to 'The Mushroom Lady, Scotland' found their way to the correct professor of mycology at the University of Edinburgh!
Yup, there's been some much more cryptic post make it to its intended destination. 
Google Maps doesn't always get postcodes right. I used to live in a house on the corner of a small road and a main road. The address and postcode were that of the small road, yet Google insisted it had the address of the small road but the postcode of the main road.
Skerries School  East Isle  Out Skerries  SHETLAND  ZE2 9AR  Is the royal mail generated address for it.  But theres like 60 people there. IIRC stuff has been sent to the shetlands with the address. 'That tall english bloke, shetland' and still got there.
you gotta love old style postal service. I lived in France in a village of 200 people. Many houses, an old ruined castle, but no house numbers, no street signs, no street lights. The mail always got to me, and when I moved to an even smaller hamlet (population 7) the postman told me to not worry about the forwarding, as he was the delivery guy for that hamlet too. This even before I went to the postal office in the big town to arrange for forwarding. 
Sounds like Ireland. An Post must be supermen.  They recently introduced post codes but no one uses them. Aside form the bigger cities most addresses just list the name of the village. No house or street name or anything  It's a complete pain in the arse for me.
but but but - global village has arrived. Next I will move to Ireland. Any recommendations?
Galway is great if you love culture, history and rain.  Kerry is lovely if you like scenery, lack of people and rain.
and Cork? Rain, and what?
silly accents
I am reading a book set in Cork and am having a hoot trying to understand the slang language. Me gran was a Waterford girl before she came to Canada.
> ZE2 9AR  As Demoneggy said, the rest of the address would be enough to get it delivered correctly.  However, if you Google the school name it comes up with 9AS.
But if you google the school name it shows it on another island, next to an air field. That does not seem to be the island in question.
There are two islands joined by a bridge - the post office is on the left hand island, the school is on the right, the two islands together are known as 'Skerries'. It will get there don't worry!
Actually my good search for Skerries School brings me to Fair Island. https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Skerries+School/@59.5327388,-1.6343553,14.46z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x489c143bffffffff:0xee310f7dc5649083  But that is Google's fault. As you said I am sure it will get there based on the rest of the address.
That's very weird!   Rest assured if you use either of the two addresses listed in the Stickied thread on the /r/Scotland frontpage your card will get there no problem :)
The OP address says ZE21, which is the wrong part. ZE2 is right, and neither ZE2 9AS nor ZE2 9AR gives an error. But DemonEggy's right - the cards will get there!
One thing tough. I did a search for the school name and it points to another Island, next to an airfield. That is clearly not the island in question.
Was he moved a few inches out of his normal position? :P
The loneliest postman in the world.
You should send him a big wall map, and include thumb tacks, beforehand.  Maybe a note with it, like "things to come".  I know I would have lived to keep track of all the places I got cards from.
If I received a map, some pins and a note saying "things to come" I'd probably go into hiding.. Haha.
How much further can you possibly go into hiding then an island off Scotland where only 65 people live and you are the only student in anything resembling a school? Seriously, this island might be the last hiding spot for 62 people in dire fear of their lives and one oblivious family who just like having some company for once. 
To be fair, the article giving away his exact location doesn't help with hiding.
So cynical.. Lol
Good luck hiding on that island 
Haha
"There's a scale on the bottom so you can work out exactly how far away from the Mainland you are"  :/
I think this is a great idea.
Seriously someone should coordinate this with his teacher because I think this is an awesome idea!!   I love looking at those types of pinned posters when I go to someplace new that is known to (or visited from) people around the world. It could also be used as a teaching tool to segue into, or use with, world history.
Coloured thumbtacks with coloured yarn too.  Give him some long term use.
Speaking of [maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Housay,+United+Kingdom/@60.420791,-0.77641,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x489e4fc32cf90595:0x88082fa656023944?hl=en-US), you don't have to zoom out very far before his island disappears.   
Yeah...it's pretty isolated
How about "With love from..." 
Hi! You can also try posting in /r/randomactsofcards
Just cross posted there as I didn't see it there :)
Lovely idea. I'm going to ask a friend who's a primary head to ask her P5 class to send a Christmas card to him.
I have a friend who's a teacher who's going to do the same with her class!
My mom is a Principal in the US (I don't know what you would call them... and I feel stupid taking guesses.  Let's just say she is the Dumbledore of her school) and I reached out to her to see if her school or children would be interested in reaching out also.
"Dumbledore of her school" - That made me laugh. We call them Head Teachers, but most people understand what the Principle is.
This is a different word in American English.  Principal = head of a school (he's your pal!)  Principle = fundamental truth or basis of something, like when calculating interest.
>(he's your pal!)  he's not your pal, buddy
I'm not your buddy, chief. 
I'm not your chief, chef. 
I'm not your chef, chef.
> he's not your pal, buddy  The mnemonic would be so much more fun if the word was "princibastard" 
He's not your buddy, chum.
They are different words here too, the other user just used the wrong one. 
I am glad to make you smile!    I look forward to having my mother's school reach out!
I saw what you did there.
My chum has spoken to kids at her school and it's also now making its way through facebook with lots of shares...   I imagine one of our resident or lurking journos might want to follow this up with a wee trip to Skerrie to see the wee fellers face. 
I'm a P6 teacher - I'll get my kids on it too.
My gf is a special Ed teacher...gonna see if she wants to join in with this too
Brilliant!
This is a really lovely idea. Would be great if as many of us as possible do it!   Postman will get a shock though. 65 people probably don't get that much mail. 
Found this via /r/UK. I've set a reminder to post one (from Leeds) next weekend - this is a lovely idea.  As you're in touch with the school, I don't suppose that you could suggest that they send a followup? I'd love to know how many cards he gets, or even see a picture of his haul!
I will be contacting the school again next Monday to let them know about the posts and that we'd be sending on that day so I'll be sure to mention that we'd appreciate a follow up!
Do you want international cards to be sent before Dec 7th? I just want to make sure the cards are getting there in time. Southern United States here.   Edit: Typo
Southern US, too. I'm in, and considering sending a little boat or something. I was living in Northern France when i was about this kid's age, and I had quite a collection of beach stuff... Except the water was cold as heck, so we couldn't actually go swimming often... I'll have to give it some thought, though, and come up with something clever.  But my initial thought is, kid wants to be a fisherman and has an interest in the world about him, so I'm thinking about a little model ship. I know of a brand that floats and it should be sea worthy in fairly calm waters. I'll have to see how much international shipping is, too...
Haha. For a moment there I thought you were planning on plopping a little boat in the sea and hoping the gulf stream would carry it to Shetland  Your actual idea sounds beautiful though!
I'm pretty sure the little flat rate boxes at the USPS are same rate for international shipping.
As a three rematch secret santa this year with all matches international from the US this is the farthest from the truth, unfortunately :(  I'm still trying to figure out how im going to cover 180 bucks in shipping fees   
I used to ship to Japan a lot, check out if EMS has any service to where you're posting. They had the best rates and fastest delivery. Whatever you do don't use the Parcel Post, they definitely wouldn't get it this year (if ever).
What is EMS?  I have one who said i can ship by boat and he'll be happy. =)   I think i found a russian airbnb guest to take my russian package and mail there.  paying him a few beers and postage from moscow is over 50% cheaper than paying for postage direct from here.  Now I just have ireland i think.
Oh, I'm sorry! :( 
Nice.
If you think that the cards will take some time to get here and might be too late by the 7th post them at the end of this week instead! Even if the card comes a little late I'm sure it will get there in enough time to be relevant. Thanks for the effort!
Maybe you should get in touch with the post office there and give them a heads up. They could perhaps hold off the delivery for everything to that address until a specific date? Not a usual thing to do, but if there are only 65 people on the island they must know each other, they might bend the rules...
post offices are pretty serious about delivering mail, im sure it will be against their regulations to delay it.
Yeah, that's called "Willful Delay", and is considered gross misconduct. 
Never sent something through Canada post have you? 
Not since I left Canada...
LOL I was thinking the same thing. My postman will sometimes not even attempt to deliver my package and since I know it's coming I will go to the post office to see the note saying "attempted delivery on X date" and that date was a Sunday. So sure, I know you never actually attempted to buzz me because I work from home... but also you put the date as the single day you are most certainly not working. 
He is already in touch with the school so why not ask them or have them ask the parents? That would be a lot easier than asking the post office.
I'm not too up on mail times. If I send one from San Francisco California when should I ship?
It'll take about 6-10 days, so I'd probably send it at the end of this week.  I'm in DC and that's when I plan to send mine just to be on the safe side.
LA area here, I'll send mine a few days before the 7th.
I'm not subbed and saw this on my frontpage. Will grab a card in the morning and have the family sign it for the little lad.      I cant imagine what his house will look like with 200 cards let alone 200,000
I know, he'll be able to use them as wallpaper if this keeps gaining pledges the way it's currently doing so!
This really cheered me up. Just imagine that wee boy's face. What a lovely thing to do xxx
If this cheers you up just imagine what it will do for the wee man :) I'm quite excited, hope a lot of people take part!
I'm thinking you might also want to give the post office on that island a heads up...
Yup! That will be one of two phonecalls I'll make next at the end of the week :)
Based on what I'm seeing, you might want to do it a bit earlier.
[deleted]
Already got my card bought and signed mate! Been buzzing to tell folk since I thought of it. 
[deleted]
Do what ya gotta do! See if you can get some friends or family in NZ to send one too. 
I'm in NZ and sending a card.
Post in the PM daily about it?
closest to his antipode so far...
Excellent!
Is Sweden allowed to send one too?  I'm making so many this year that I don't have the heart to let him go without one!
Should we let Sweden play ? :D 
Eh. Sweden is cool. Let em cheer a kid up on Christmas 
You're ok to go Sweden WOOHOO!!
Also a New Zealander, I might send one as well, as I have Scottish heritage.  
Ditto 
Right that's folk in the States, Wales, Spain, Cotswolds, Devon, Wales and three schools all signed up.
> and three schools all signed up.  How did you manage that?
Well I'm off the register now...   Friends in education. There's a primary school in Birmingham whose head teacher wants to make a visit!
>Well I'm off the register now...   I'm worried about what register you were on...   
Electoral, he's done with politics.
Weight watchers...
That makes perfect sense - don't know why it didn't occur to me!

3 Forever stamps will cover it.  
You sure?  I'll probably stop by my post officer and check though.  I happen to find an entire freshly purchased book of stamps outside my chipotle(there is a post office in the same complex) a few months ago.  All I send out is 3-4 pieces of mail a year, so I have no reason not to send this kid a nice post card.
You can get a "Global Forever" stamp for $1.10 - that'll do it. 
Yeah, I checked on the website and I want to say the postage was $1.20 to send it to Scotland which is classified as a postage 3 category (or whatever the proper terminology is.)  Global Forever stamp is another perfect option if you want to be sure.  
Fer chrissake don't go near the post office this time of year. Look it up on their website. 
I have a pretty awesome post office.  They have 4 automated machines, and normally an employee in the lobby to answer questions.  Then they have one line and 4 cashiers/tellers working them.  Things more well there.

It was me ya dumb bot!
/r/botsrights !
One of the links from /r/bestof is on the front page of /r/all right now (spot 92), possibly rising.  I'll gladly send a postcard from Sweden (on the 7th), but you should really let the local post office know, if you didn't already!
Oahu, Hawaii here. Would a Hawaiian themed Christmas card in place of a postcard be okay?   Also, what a sweet idea, thanks for putting this together!
Do the touristy thing and mail him a coconut!
[Excellent idea](http://i.imgur.com/OpAl4mP.jpg)!!
Will also send a Hawaii-themed christmas card!
Certainly that would be fine :)
Why not before the 7th? I don't see a reason why anywhere?  Also I'm out at sea, but I'll pink this to the missus and see if she can get one sent from Sweden. That's the reason I ask about the date.  Edit: Okay, missed the reason, d'oh, I feel a bit stupid now! Message sent, hopefully she'll send one from me (and her).
Brisbane, Australia checking in. I'll get a card that has an Aussie Christmas scene on it (beach, BBQ, Santa in boardies).
Sounds like I'd enjoy that card myself :p!
Sending something Texas-y from Texas 🇨🇱
It's a gun, isn't it? 
Pennsylvania checking in. It's a BMI all time high scores list.
Finland signing up, and I believe some from our sub will contribute also. The land of snow, reindeer and Santa Claus has to be included in this!
Of course, tervetuloa!
Sorry if I missed it but you probably are going to cover the end result somehow, with a pic of the kid covered in his Christmas cards or something like that?  Nice idea, and awesome that redditors are ready to be part of this.  I believe sending on Friday covers it..
When I phone up the school to let them know just how much of a success it has been, I'll ask if they can email me some photos of him opening the cards with his teachers/parents :)
[deleted]
Great news!
Ah why not, alright I'm up for this.  Funny how I'm more eager to send a card to some random child than to my family.  Then again, I've met my family.
Can you edit out the expletive mate? Just in case he looks in on this post let's try and keep it PG!  And great that you're taking part!
Roger that, no worries.
Denmark signing in. I plan to let my boys help me on this, they might learn that there is children out there having a much harder time than them when the Internet is down.
Yay! Was looking for another Dane! 
Great idea. Takk! No idea if that's correct Danish but it's close enough you know what I mean I hope :p
You are welcome, Tak goes to you for this great summoning of kindness of international proportion 
I'll send one from Aberdeen ☺️
Sending one from Shanghai. Hope that helps :)
Yup, absolutely!
Just sort of stumbled in here from the front page and don't see Montana represented. I'll send the little sweetheart a card from the Badlands :D
Will be sending one from Tasmania, Australia! One end of the globe to the other
Might be quicker to trek over Antarctica, make the delivery by hand ;)
Nice idea - good on you! You might want to x-post this to the other (uk) subreddits.
This is a wonderful idea, /u/BesottedScot. I'll try to find a good card for this...
Michigan here, sending one this week to make sure it gets there in time :) 
Denver, CO (US) here - we'll send a card!
I'm in Denver and sending one as well! I love this idea so much!
Denver here too! I'm in. 
Hooray!
Got some awesome fishin postcards here in Winnipeg, Canada. Count me in
Winnipeg FTW! 
I'll see what I can scrounge up. Maybe a postcard with a pic of the Forks.
Cool cool. I haven't been to the Forks since the new museum was being built. I've heard it's quite pretty! 
It's certainly an interesting looking building. I do like it, but it does dominate the skyline.
I can remember when I was a kid I'd often take my bike and explore all the old train yards where the Forks now is. That was awesome fun... I'm glad they kept a couple of the buildings, but it used to be full of great (and likely dangerous)  places to sneak in to... 
Sending one from Middle of nowhere Oklahoma USA, you're the best /r/Scotland <3
I think I can send him something. It will be from the furthest away... now to go find some cool Indian Christmas cards. 
Great idea, mate! 
He'll be getting at least one from Melbourne Australia!
First New Zealand now Oz, nice to see the southern hemisphere taking part!
I'm in. Everyone should get a card from the craziest state in the USA.
Which one is the craziest one?..   Florida's a good bet.
I got  FL  covered :-)
Stay classy Florida. 
FL checking in.
Haha. Nice.
I'm in from Kansas. We are pretty crazy, but in a low-key, passive-aggressive sort of way.
We're on it.
Hi! Singaporean here, mind if I x-post this to /r/Singapore? :P
Guadalajara Mexico joining, I'll try to get a toy in the mail too, do we want the postcards to be there before or on the 24th?
Before or on, either would be fine. As long as it's the month of December we'll be doing good ;)
Thanks, I'll try to get some friends in
My ancestors immigrated from the Shetlands in 1868. Aron can expect a card from the middle of Canada. (Is it Aron with one A?)
It is indeed!
So how does the address look if I'm shopping international? Just write Scotland on top of the postcard?
> Mr Aron Anderson  > c/o Skerries School  > Skerries  > Shetland  >UNITED KINGDOM (OR SCOTLAND WORKS TOO)  > ZE21 9AS  
Thanks!
Hey Guys, My mate started an app up where you take a photo from your phone and make a postcard out of it and he does all the work printing and posting it! I think if you share it on facebook you get a free postcard, so if the post office scares you (its like jurassic park, somethings were meant to be extinct a long time ago!) and wanna get a postcard out to this lad from the comfort of your own bed check it out!   www.photopostcards.com.au
Me and my happy hour crew will be sending a card from Portland, Oregon on Friday!
Good man! (or woman!).
I hope this gets a reddit hug of sorts
Once I get back up and about from a nasty head cold I want to contribute!  From Oregon in the US.  Our local sports mascot is a duck,  so that might play a role in the postcard I send! 
Another from Oregon coming. Go Ducks!
That is so sweet. Kentucky here.
One postcard from Washington DC coming up.  Awesome idea guys!
I'll send one from Disney World! This is so nice of you to arrange!
I'll be sending one from Gloucestershire!
That's at least two from this fair county then!
Ontario, Canada checking in! Just mailed Aron's card with a bit 'o something from the great white north!!! :o)
was it some snow? I'm going to post my card in a few hours!
I thought about sending a can of it (literally! - just add water!) - Wait - could be a third parcel heading his way :) hehe...
It'll be like that John Lewis advert.
Hi!  I can send one from Brazil too!    Could you please confirm the address that I should put on the postcard? 
The address is in the body of the post. You can add SCOTLAND or UNITED KINGDOM right above the post code :)
oh good, that's what I was wondering about.  thanks
California checking in, my two Scottish terriers Fyfa and Wallace will be featured, sending love from the land of fruits and nuts :)  This thread is so sweet I'm almost determined to ship myself to Scotland and make a go of it. Repatriation 370 years after immigration, that's probably cool with customs, right? 
I'm sure if you were determined enough it would be a cinch :)
Well get the independence vote rolling again already, so I don't have to deal with the British. They hold long grudges.   Edit: English, not British. Sheesh. It's a pretty common colloquialism here. But it doesn't mean I failed geography or don't know about the 600 year fight for Scottish independence.
> I'm almost determined to ship myself to Scotland  >don't have to deal with the British.  ?  Scotland is physically part of Britain just like England and Wales is, British doesn't mean just English mate. Scots are British because they live on the island(s) of Britain 
I hope Russian Post will be so fast as possible. Me and my children will sent a postcard, but I think it's too late. I think he recieved a card about 12-15 of december! But its better then nothing!!!  vlad, Anna, Ivan
That's absolutely fine! As long as he receives it in the month of December :) спасибо!
Your Appalachian cousins from /r/Knoxville are in!
Any updates on this?
Yep! http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/britains-loneliest-schoolboy-gets-over-7028442 
Las vegas,  NV checking in to send a post card :)
I live in the United States. Can anyone give me an idea of when I should send a card so that it arrives around the same time as everyone else's?
Post yours a few days early at least. You want yours to be on mainland Scotland the same time the others have been sorted dispatched. 
I  sending mine tonight from Boston MA. It usually takes about five business days when I send cards home to my uk family, so I figure it will be about right. 
[deleted]
Other comments say that the end of this week should be fine 
[deleted]
Sure thing! 
This may have already been asked, but I live in the US.  I assume our postage will take longer to arrive.  Do you still want all shipments postmarked on Monday the 7th?  Or for those of us international folks, do you want it to send out earlier?
If you send out Friday it shouldn't take too much longer to get there, before Christmas though certainly. 
Since we are mailing to the school, Does the school close for Christmas break and if so, do you know from when to when? When you spoke with them, did they give you a hard 'delivery by' date?   I'm guessing if the school is closed for 2 weeks for the holiday, the post office will hold all this mail that arrives after they close?   This is a great thing you are organizing!
The school does not close for Christmas until the 22nd. Plenty of time to get your card there!
Thanks for the update!
Awesome.  I will pick up my card today!!
ATL, GA, USA checking in. Count me in
I'm in. As an Oklahoman, this story is going international so they will most definitely get a load of cards.
Auld Alliance reporting in, I've posted in /r/france about this !  Let's make him drown in postcards !
Excellent it's in the National now, maybe some of those Southern flâneur's in Kirkwall will send a card Northwards...   http://www.thenational.scot/news/card-appeal-to-bring-cheer-to-britains-loneliest-schoolboy.10621?utm_medium=social&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_term=Autofeed#link_time=1448953292

I'm in the US & I'm in! (I was redirected from /r/RandomActsofCards)
I'm in! Unfortunately I live in Glasgow so I can not offer him a nice, exotic postmark. I hope he isn't too disappointed 
I'm in England, postcard coming his way from foreign lands. 
Minnesota. We're in. 
I'm in! I'm from a little town in Florida that is known for its fishing so I asked all my Facebook friends to send postcards from there or pics of some of the local fish. Good job OP!
Pals from Murica here, sending freedom and post cards :) 
2.5 hours from *Lerwick*??? It took me longer to get to Lerwick (from Northumberland) than it takes me to get to Boston or Orlando...!
Best of delivers. np be damned. When you say postcards, must they be Christmas themed?
They don't have to be, it can be a picture of your city or country if you wish!
I am sending a card :) What a Great way to make him feel special! and a lot less lonely! :) I am sending it from Canada, should I still wait until Dec 7th to send? Or should I send it right away...Thank you for organizing :)
Yep the 7th. Unless you think it might take too long in which case send it Thursday or Friday :)
I am in too. First lad from Germany I think. This is awesome! BTW is the address correct? I found this: http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/myschool/findaschool/schools/skerriesschoolshetlandislands.asp
I think you were beat to the punch by a young 15 year old lad! But the second German I think yes :D thank you for taking part!
I'll be sending a postcard from Portugal, along with my wife. What an excellent idea.
Obrigado :)
You are sending him your wife? That is generous!
Sending Cheer from NorthWest Indiana, SE of Chicago, town of Crown Point!  This is one of those warmest sentimental things I want to be a part of.  Going viral!  Will forward info to my family in Fort Worth, Texas and Flora, Mississippi, USA and Oranmore, Ireland to do the same.  Bless you all for making smiles.
Sending him one from Virginia USA courtesy of the chive. This kid is going to get more mail than will fit on that island of his. KCCO
Thank you!
The Royal Mail are going to implode up there lol   I think they only have literally one or two posties for the whole Island 
Just one postwoman :)
Sent my Christmas card today. Walking home from the post office I realized this is not for a school boy, it's DDoS attack on Royalmail in Scotland
A real life DDoS!
Great idea!
Any idea what a post card from the states would cost for postage?
An international postcard is $1.20, max size of 6" by 4-1/4"  -edit- that's the first class mail price. if you choose to ship by priority mail (with a guaranteed 6-10 day delivery) the price goes up to somewhere around $20 IIRC
Not sure if this helps, but we sent a letter from the uk to the USA last week and it was only £1.33 in postage!
[deleted]
Three Forever stamps or one Global Forever stamp.
I'm in. West coast of Ireland.
Throwing in a reply to remind me when it's not almost 3am. U.K. Based, but will send a card/postcard of my area!
I'm going to send one from Miami!
Me too!! What should  we send him from our warm city? 
A $25 drink from the Delano?! Haha.  Seriously, I'm not sure.  A beach ball?  Dolphins Jersey might be cool?  Any ideas?
hm... ORANGES? he's 10 though.. I haven't been ten in YEARS what do 10yr olds LIKE?!
Thought that, but they might not let you send fruit.  
Sending from Texas, USA!  :) 
Beautiful.
These are going to the school so they'll catch them if they get there early?  I only ask because I'd love to read my kids the story & have them draw something.  We are in southern California so I have no idea how long it would take
If you send them on Monday, Dec 7, they should get there. It isn't Mars! I've sent a package containing a baby sweater to rural England (from California); it took about two weeks. 
But this is an island with a small population.  Does mail run as regularly as elsewhere?  I only mention this because I know of some remote areas that only get weekly mail.  I admit to being a bit ignorant here which is why I'm asking
You're quite right. It probably takes an extra few days compared to the mainland. 
It shouldn't. Unless the Ferry is delayed. Universal Service Obligation says we have to deliver to every address in the UK, without delay.   Source: postie who hates Xmas. 
Since you are a postie, maybe you can you please confirm what the FULL and correct international mailing address and FORMAT should be?   The address as currently posted above lists only Shetland and poking around I seen that it looks like it should be Shetland Islands.   There is no county listed. Should it be Scotland, UK? Just UK?  A vast majority of this is going to be coming from around the world, outside of the U.K.  People are saying 'it's a small island, they will know", but  it has to get TO the island first.  And I can guarantee some postman sorting mail here in the US or India or other parts would most likely not know where  Shetland is, to even get it to the UK in the first place. International Zip codes all have different formats and without even a county as reference  listed in the address, the international mail is going to have a much greater delay, if it even arrives at all.   I would hate for all this good will to be wasted!  
No, you're right, you need to put either Scotland or United Kingdom on it. Either one will do. Saying that, as long as it has international postage on it, your postal system will figure out where it's going by the post code. Remember, it will first go to the US Post international sorting office, where they know how to recognise post codes. :) But yes, you're right, you should probably put Scotland or UK on it. 
Arizona here, I think we can get him one!
Jackalope! Send a postcard of a Jackalope!
I'll send one as well. 
I'm going to get my whole office to ship him a Christmas card
Visitor here, will send one from here. Loving the Christmas spirit! 
If I send it from abroad, what country should I use below the postal code? United Kingdom? Scotland? 
Post is actually sorted officially by 'Great Britain'. Northern Ireland gets sorted with Ireland'a post.  Personally, I would put 'Scotland, GB', but I'm sure all three would work, especially as it says 'Shetland' on it!  Where are you sending from?
Either or Will be fine 
Either should be fine! 
This sounds fun. Will send something from Japan.
I'm interested but I'm from the US. If I send this on the 7th will it still arive on time?
Bump. OP?
Great Idea u/BesottedScot! I'll arrange something! 
A bunch of my friends and I are sending cards from Florida, and I promise there won't be any guns or "Florida Crazy" sent that may rub off of him. 
For international mail, should the word SCOTLAND be on there somewhere?
Yup, put Scotland in big letters under the post code, please! 
He'll be getting one from Dublin :)
why does the address not say 'Scotland' ?
Most people involved in the mail delivering business will know where Shetland is. The postcode is the only really important part. But certainly, adding Scotland can't do any harm. 
San Francisco checking in, spent every summer in Strathtay 15 miles outside Pitlochry. I'm intimately familiar with youthful Scottish loneliness. I've rallied my kids to the cause, we're in!
Toronto in Canada here. I'll send a card :) Good on you for arranging all this.
I'm in from Louisiana, USA! Just saw this first today in a Scottish FB group. Used the postcard app speedytulls posted - cracker of an idea!  
Would someone be willing to send a card for my wife and I?  I'll gladly pay postage and what not with bitcoin via changetip!
Hi, PM me what you'd like to say and I'll do it. No charge :) 
No. I was going to box up some tumble weed and a real cowboy. None of this playing with figurines, why not the real thing.   Besides, he will learn that Everything's bigger in Texas.   🌵🌇  📦
I want to do this! I have to mail cards that day anyway. Yay!
Yay!
[removed]
Not sure what you meant to type but I'm removing this comment for now...
It's a good thing I have to get stamps tomorrow from the post office for my cards that I send to Romania and Australia every year. I think I can spring for one more :) Sending from the Midwest, USA :D 
I'm not a Scotsman but can I also join the fray? Surely a postcard from Ukraine would be even a bigger novelty? 
Of course you can! 
I'm going to make him a christmas card rather than buy a generic one. Maybe others should to? It's more personal :)
Already done! :D
This is brilliant. I really needed a little pick me up today and you guys never fail. I'm in.
Removed. Rule 10. Sorry.
My class in Andalucía, Spain are going to send a massive card. Great idea!
Muchos gracias mi amigo!
*amiga 😉  De nada!
My mother is a teacher in Sardinia. I could ask if she and her class could do something, maybe a big postcard! 
I sent him a book called 100 ways to cook a duck
count us in -the inbound team at ANT :) 
I'm in too. Let's show this wee man some Christmas love. He's got pals.
he'll get one from Croatia too :) Good thing I love to send post and greeting cards :) 
Serbia, Bosnia, now Croatia! Good stuff!
Hi, I want to take part in it))) I'm from Moscow.  But, I think, that the letter will come later, then 25th of December( And can you explain me, where is the postcode?
The postcode is the 7 letters/numbers at the bottom of the address - in this case ZE21 9AS :)
I hate to say but I really hope 4chan doesn't try to show their ugly head in this. I would hate for that poor kid to get letters from some of those sadistic people.
That is why I advised his parents and teachers supervise the opening of them :)
Awesome! That gives me some peace of mind that he will have a good Christmas.
Third German in as far as I can tell! Hope he enjoys my tiny card sent from Berlin. :)
Danke schön!
Just came across this via an outside article, and think it's a lovely idea.   I'm forgoing Secret Santa this year after a terrible experience last Christmas, but I'd still like to send some cheer somewhere. Has there been any discussion of Aron's likes, in case one *were* to send a gift?
I'm not really sure myself to be honest. I know the original article says he's keen to be a fisherman and that he has a dog. Apart from that he's a regular 10 year old boy! I'm sure that he would be happy with almost anything.
I'll be back home visiting family next week so if I remember I'll send him one from Italy!
Going to send one from Toronto Canada!
Thank you!
I'm also in. Card will be send from Poland:) Hope he will enjoy it:)
Great, thanks!
I'm gonna send christmas card from Belgium :D
Sending one from Portugal, ready to be posted on Friday.
Excellent! Obrigado :)
France here, I'm totally in!!
I'm in!
Myself and some friends are sending a couple of Boeing themed post cards from Seattle, WA! Great idea.
Good effort, thank you!
We'll send from Russia, the idea IS great!
Bretagne, France in the place ;)
Guelph, Ontario, Canada checking in.
Glad to hear it, welcome aboard!
Picked up my postcards and stamps today, will mail tomorrow.
Good on you!
northern bc canada...already talked to prinicpals in both schools about making him smile
Excellent, thank you for taking part!
I will send to him a card . i'm from france
Merci, mon ami :)
I'll be sending one from the grim suburbs of North London.  
I've just read about this in my local newspaper, and I'm in France! This is a fantastic idea!!
I've posted a link and details of this thread on my twitter so hopefully that means more people will get involved! This is such a lovely idea! 
Good to hear, thanks for taking part :)!
Found this thread on mentalfloss, and I can't believe no one from my hometown (Philippines) or my adopted city (Tokyo) chimed in! Consider the the two countries repped and ready to pitch in! :D
Hooray! Arigato and salamat :D
Some people here in Latvia will post several cards as well :3 
paldies :)!
I'll send him one from Dublin (I am a Scot doing a PhD here so)   My family are from the Orkneys, now I see why they moved to Edinburgh and Carlisle   
Quite sad really, the islands are beautiful as well!   Cheers mate.
I have been there a couple of times, its kinda interesting my Great Grandmother had a Norwegian surname since the Islands were once part of Norway.   I only wanted to do the Shortest flight in the world (I am a plane nut so) 
Saw that post on Twitter and thought it's a good idea. Share it too and he'll receive a huge load of paper on Xmas :)
Sing up to Reddit just to support You. I'm in ! 
Great stuff! Thank you!
I come from France and I will send a card for this little guy! :-)
Merci!
Card will be sent from Ontario, Canada! 
I'm from Shetland and can I just say this is such a wonderful idea I hope he loves it. :)
I shared this story on air in the North East (America, from Vermont to New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and even QC, Canada) today during my "Light Lunch Hour Program".  I hope our listeners respond! Great idea!
Thanks a lot, me too!
I will be sending one from Kentucky USA
I'm in and the card is on its way.
I sent one yesterday. Ontario Canada. Thanks for organizing!
Belgium checking in. Will buy a card first thing tomorrow and send it on it's merry way to Scotland :)
Romanian here, just found out. I'll handle this tomorrow.  Also, Merry Christmas Aron!
My sister is a kindergarten teacher in San Francisco, California. She got her class to make cards and I believe she's mailing them out this week.
Excellent! Thank her for me :)
We sent our postcard yesterday from Germany :)
Danke :)
Came to this thread from Arstechnica, and my daughter was so touched (11) she's writing a small note in a card right now.   We're in the south of England so it's not going to be exotic but still it's another card!
I wouldn't say that. Skerries to Surrey is a further distance than London to Madrid! Thank you to you and your daughter :)
She has also decided to discuss with the local school head as well.  If that's likely to generate more cards I'll let you know.
Great, thanks!
According to Amazon, Aron should be receiving a copy of a great book on the 15th of December. Please forgive me, as I forgot to post something here when I originally placed the order. Though the choice of the title is mildly ironic, my hope is that the book passes on some adventurous inspiration. Greetings from Brooklyn! 
That's very gracious of you! Thank you for taking part in my little venture :)
Sent a card out this morning from Dallas, TX, USA!  I enclosed a coin, a Texas State Quarter to serve as a reminder of where the card came from. I'm not sure if he's much of a coin collector, but as a child I always enjoyed getting coins from far away lands.  Can't wait to see how many cards he gets!
I joined the party late, but I will send one out to him too from the U.S. (MN/WI)! Hope he got a ton of cards the past few weeks :) 
Who's cutting damn onions? Eyes gone all blurry now.
I b broke down in tears
JUST DO IT
Okey OP, challenge accepted 😉
I'm in, I'm going to show the story to my kids and see if they want to write to him :) 
Done.  I have 2 friends that teach kids in local schools around the Borders.  I forwarded this info and asked them to get their students involved. :)

Commenting so I can find later
NYC standing by!
California checking in. I'm going to try to send him a post card! 
Dinky little town no one's heard of here! I'm in!
Midwestern United States checking in. We'll send a card next week!
Excellent! He can expect a card from California!!
This is so simple to do and sounds like fun, I'm in! I shall pick out a card to send tomorrow! 
I'll send one from Iowa US.
Idk why I just have a bad feeling about the school address going viral.. 
It is publicly available information which you can find on the council website. All you need is a postcode anyway!
!remindme 7 hours
Ohio here! No idea how to represent the state in any way that makes sense to this little guy but I'll do what I can! 
Commenting so I can find later. I'll send a postcard from NZ. 
Hah... ive had an unused Christmas Card on my desk since last christmas as a reminder to send out cards in time this year... guess its getting used as well :)
Maryland USA coming in through the side hatch!!!! 
Brilliant idea! I'll be sending something his way.
USA west coast is in the house but I haven't seen Washington State, so I'm in. Thanks for doing this sweet, thoughtful act!
Tacoma, Washington is so down for this! 
Western Kentucky here, I'll see what I can do this week. No promises though.
/u/BesottedScot, normally I don't post on threads I find in /r/bestof, but I felt this was worth mentioning. If you're going to be showing him this thread, and want everything to be age appropriate (language-wise), bear in mind the sidebar will be visible. In particular, Rule 4, 13.
He's a kid, but he's still Scottish. He'll be okay. :) 
Sending one from India.
Dhanyavaad / Abhara! (I think that's right?)  Thank you :) 
You're welcome! :)
Massachusetts here! I'll send one too.
Chiming in from Arizona, I'll send a post card. 
Just to let everyone know, the post in Shetland can be very temperamental and slow, particular at this time of year with weather delays. I would recommend sending everything as early as possible. As in now. Surely his teacher could collect them all and give them to him on the last day of school, so it doesn't matter what day they arrive?
When I phoned to let them know what I was planning, I mentioned this exact question and their response was that they get post delivered 4-5 times a week. I don't think it will be too much of an issue or a problem to get them by Christmas if sending on the 7th. Especially since post will be prioritised for Christmas anyway.  Of course if you're worried you can post earlier, but I don't think there's a need!
Oh I thought you wrote 17th, and that is really late! 7th should be fine. We do get the post every day up here, but there are so much unpredictable delays in the winter.
Ah right!  Yeah, I erred on the side of caution with the 7th, plus it gives a week for the post to generate some attention. Thanks for the feedback!
Well it's all over my facebook feed with us Shetlanders, so news travels fast! :) 
Great to hear!  I've actually never been to the northern Isles. Maybe I should put it on my bucket list for next year :-)
!Remind Me 1 Week
I'm in. I'm also a teacher, might be fun to get some of my kids to send him a card too, they will find this whole 'only kid in the school' thing amusing.  Will be sending a post card and something stereotypically Australian to the little bloke from West Oz.
Offer it as extra credit if they bring in a postcard, envelope and post stamp. That way it's completely optional, yet they have incentive as well. 
Hi!  I can send one from Brazil too!    Could you please confirm the address that I should put on the postcard? 
I wish I could get my classes to do this, because it'd spread so much festive cheer. Alas, I only see them three days a week, and wouldn't be able to get them all done by next week :(  But I'm definitely off to send my own postcard from Liverpool. This is such a lovely thing, and being lonely sucks. I hope he enjoys all of the love he'll be getting and he wont feel so lonely.
!remindme 10am December 7
*Followed Bestof link*   I think that anyone sending the cards **Internationally** should send them early, as that mail does take a bit more time. I'm going to share this with my mom and he's going to get (at least) two (post)cards from Florida.
Cross posted it to /r/assistance for you. Sending a card today.
If teachers and the bairn in question are to be actively linked to this post, maybe rule 4 in the 'Subreddit rules and info' could do with being replaced by a more... family-oriented adjective? 
Yup. I've censored it for now. Unless you're savvy to reddit it will just show asterisks.
Gonna share this with folk in my department since a load of them are from all over the place, so that'll give a good variety.  Also my girlfriend is a primary school teacher so gonna get her to get her class involved.  Good effort getting this organised!
I will get a card out for him.
Moved to Scotland a few months ago, how does post work here? Is there a post office where I can buy everything from the stamp to posting it?
Yup. Post offices sell whatever you need. You can either buy a book of stamps, or just a single stamp from the counter. You can also buy books of stamps from loads of other shops, too... 
Does a letter cost the same regardless of the location as long as it's within scotland?
Yup, a letter anywhere in the UK costs the same. I could send a letter to my neighbour or to the most southerly tip of Cornwall, and it would cost the same. 
Yup. Your local post office will have everything you need to send a letter :)
Saw this on the front page. Will send him one from Florida!
about how long would it take to send a card from the states?  i don't want it to get there super late  :c
remind me! 2 weeks 
remindme! 2 weeks 
Fellow Shetlander here - not from Out Skerries, but live on Mainland island. This is such a lovely gesture - I know what it feels like to be lonely at school, as our primary school had only ~20ish pupils, and I was the only boy in my year for most of my time there. Well done to everyone involved in this for delivering gifts he will remember for the rest of his life.
The ONLY boy!? That must've been horrible in your later years of schooling.... /s  But actually, would you like a bunch of random postcards as well to fell less lonely? We could have just other males send them if you like ;)
Haha! I'm not quite as lonely as I once was at school, but thanks for the offer!
Thanks so much for the sentiments. I'm glad you reckon it will give him a Christmas to remember :)
Southern New Hampshire/Maine checking in! I'll get the local lobstah fishermen to sign one for him, ayup! It CAN get there from here!
I'll get my k-2 kids to make some cards to send him. 
[removed]
Yeah, I don't know... I'm sure your intentions are good, but a brand new account, posting about a very sketchy looking website... How about you just send the lad a card or something? :)
[removed]
I understand that, but that site still looks sketchy... 
He can expect another card from sweden :) Good initiative.  edit: got some other swedes into it too.:) 
Tennessee, USA checking in! We'll send one from the Great Smoky Mountains! 
Sounds cool, he'll be getting some holiday cheer from Casablanca, Morocco.
Thanks very much!
Sent him a copy of Cajun Night Before Christmas to enjoy over the holidays.  Because Alligators, Bayous,  Louisiana, and Santa Clause.  Probably a little young for him, but I hope he enjoys it.  Here is a video of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjbQvcDbeM  
Fantastic. Thank you very much!
I'd love to hear an update from him or the teacher before Christmas - just to see how many cards he actually got! The poor postie won't know what hit him!
I'll see if I can get them to take some pictures and send them along to me and I'll post them up in a follow up post :)
Will send one from Holland! Lovely idea!
Los Angeles, Here. I'll send him one from Hollywood!
>so any inappropriate commentary will be removed.  And then there's item #4 in the sidebar :P
Yeah censored for just now though, you'll only really see it if you're savvy to reddit :)
This is a really nice thing to do, by the way. I'll be sending in a card as well!   ^_^
Great!
Thanks for sharing this - what a great idea!  My daughter is going to get her class to write a card and nice message to him from wet and windy West Yorkshire!
RemindMe! 5 days to send card from Brazil
Going to send one from Serbia :)
Hvala vam! :D
15 yo german boy here, guess im in :) 
Danke!
I've got 15 marines on board to send this kid some holiday cheer
Excellent!
RemindMe! 6 days
Great idea! I think that what you are doing here is really thoughtful and YOU are a great human being!
Nah. I'm just doing my best to spread the festiveness :)!
Shared on my FB, and trying to get all my teacher mates involved.  Should be fun.  If my luck's in, cards from Lincolnshire and Yorkshire will be weighing the postman down.
Incoming gift package from Unofficial Cardboard!
Huffington Post, too!  http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/12/01/campaign-to-post-christmas-cards-to-britains-loneliest-schoolboy_n_8688218.html  EDIT: And the Lad Bible  http://www.theladbible.com/articles/is-this-lad-from-scotland-the-loneliest-schoolboy-in-the-world
This hit the front page, and I'm glad I saw it. I have a 10 yr old son. Every year around Christmas, we try to do something anonymous to help someone else.  Funds are very tight right now but a few bucks for a post card and a stamp to make a kid smile is well worth it.  Thanks for setting this up!
No problem man thanks for taking part! Every little counts :)
Great idea. Mine's written and waiting to be posted.  
California here - definitely sending one!
I'm in :) 
I'm in :) 
Okey, I might be in. How many poststamps does it take to ship a postcard from the Netherlands to Scotland? And wich one do I put there, Scotland or United Kingdom? They're both separate lands right?
Scotland or United Kingdom, either should be fine. I'm not sure how many you would need from there though. Check with your local post office!
If we're mailing from the US should we send before December 7th?
I would say there is no pressing need to but if you're concerned send it out on Thursday or Friday :)
Wow, that's an awesome initiative! Can't wait to see the kid's reaction!
Bosnia signing in! My gf and I are going to send a card. + >9000 points to humanity!
Well, I'm in!  I live close to a newspaper store with post cards anyway so it's not like it will be alot of work!
Is Italy, Padova allowed? 
Of course!
Keep us updated during the holidays, OP!
I will do my best :)
Los Angeles, CA will be there
How fun!
Done with the card. Just waiting to deliver it now. If we're sending one from US, when do you suggest we should post it? 
Monday or Friday I would reckon! 
Lots of fishing in Alabama! I'll send him something from the Gulf Coast :) I'm so excited!! I hope someone will tell us his reaction!!
I have asked his family to take lots of pictures and send me some :) will be posting an update in /r/Scotland and in /r/pics most likely!
Has anyone warned the post office? :)
I'm sure they know by now haha!
The Netherlands checking in. I've already written my card and I'll be sending it as well. This boy is going to get a fantastic surprise! Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
No problem thanks for taking part! 
Chiming in from the United States! I'm definitely sending Aron a nice little card!
Finland representing here, will go look for a card tomorrow and have it mailed by the end of this week. Thanks for the lovely idea!
Thanks for taking part!
My office here in Devon will be sending a card, as will two classes of my nephew's primary school (also in Devon). What a lovely idea - thank you for sharing. Can't wait to see his face!
Thanks!
What a lovely thing to do! I will be sending a card from Manchester on the 7th
Cheers mate!
Sent from the USA!  I dropped it in the mail early so it gets there on time. 
Cheers man! Whereabouts in the States?
Southeastern USA. :-) 
Shetland Island has a largish population. I'm confused.
Shetland is actually an archipelago of lots of tiny islands. Google it!
No. I don't want to Google it. I just remember sweaters and ponies. A little boy way far away who's getting a lovely card from me. Fuck off Google pusher.
Aye awrite simmer haha.
One coming in from Amsterdam!
I'm in.  I will send some post cards from Brazil (Sao Paulo, Rio, and more) hoping they arrive on time and not on 2016 Christmas. 
Obrigado! :)
On it. I hope the poor kid doesn't have a fit out of shock!
So.. I speak very bad in English but I want send letter to this boy. He's very nice and it's sad that he hasn't friends. Help me and say how I can send letter 
Just write a card (it can even be in your own language!), and on the front of the envelope put:      Mr Aron Anderson         c/o Skerries School         Skerries         Shetland         ZE21 9AS         SCOTLAND  I think it would be fun for him to get cards in other languages. He can spend the dark, cold winter trying to translate them! :)
Thank you! Romania here. Let's hope our letters reach him in time.
Mine is in the post! Poor kid won't know what's hit him!
Great news! Thanks for taking part!
Just a note to say I'll be putting a card in the post tomorrow (Nottinghamshire) did not have time to get a postcard sorry
Not a problem a card is more than enough. Thank you for making the effort!
Card signed, sealed and ready to post! 
Wehey! :)
Little late but I have put a post on r/Sweden to see if anyone there wants to help out. And obviously I'll send a card myself! Good on you, sir
I was just browsing reddit today, popped up here to /r/Scotland, and see all you lads doing a kind deed! I read the story and am moved, as a Canadian I feel it is my duty to represent my country in this amazing movement!
Great news! Thanks :)
this is so awesome!!  Thank you for thinking of it!
Hi, there! Russia is in! I'll send a card today, hope it will reach Aron in time,  because we are far-far-away
Spasibo/a ! :)
A Level Photography students sending their card today! 
Great news thank you!
Sending one from Tallinn, Estonia!
Aitäh! Glad to hear it!
What a great idea! Luckily I saw this today, I shall put my card in the post tonight! 
Excellent!
Haha, I'm in too. Great, touching story. He's going to get a card from Germany! Yay! :)
Danke schon!
Bitte schön! :)
Card from Toronto is in the mail! :) - I can't wait to see how many he gets.
Thanks for taking part! Me too :)
RemindMe! 15 days
Card from Denmark went on its way three hours ago! Glædelig jul/Merry Christmas!
Tak!
I've a book of stamps lying around so why not.  One from t'north leaving soon
Ey up lad he'll be reet happy so he will :p
I'm in. From Riga, Latvia. I (anybody, actually) do not know anything about him and the environment + it is based on my interests, but I wish I could send him a 150mm telescope + star map + some book on stellar evolution. Biased - for me this would be the ultimate way to communicate that he is not alone, he is (part of) everything, that there is so much more behind the dull horizon seen every day. Romantic and naive + he's ten hehe, but - sitting on that lonely island and spending all that spare time learning and looking up in order to grow  up to be the uberastronomer, effin yeah! :)
I'm willing to be that would be fantastic - that far off the coast there will be absolutely no light pollution!  Thanks for taking part, whatever you choose to send :)  paldies!
How awesome! Sending one from MI usa :)
Yo, NYC, on the way!
IL checking in
Hey sending the card tomorrow, any chance of getting an update post once the've all been opened?  This is a lovely thing you've organised.
That's the plan! I've asked the family to take pictures of the cards and things so hopefully I will hear back from them and will post another update thread :)
Awesome, hopefully it gets the same exposure so I don't miss it!  Card has been written and is waiting to be posted tomorrow =)
Sending a postcard in from Australia :)
Cheers mate!
Sent mine today (from San Antonio, Texas)!
Thanks!
Have you got someone who will let you know when they start to arrive?
I have been in touch with the family yes so hopefully they'll update me before I can update you guys :)
Excellent - cheers!
Southern US here. I'll be sending my card out to him by the end of the week.
Thank you!
What a nice story. I just sent a copy of the American Boy's Handy Book via Amazon. The book was originally published in the 1890's by one of the founders of the Boy Scouts. My brother and I loved this book so much when we were young that the book was falling apart by the time we reached our teens. We live at the Jersey Shore in the states, and I am hoping it gets there in time for Christmas. Happy Holidays everyone!
What a lovely gesture! Thank you for taking part - I had wee look at the book and that seems like it would be very interesting to a 10 year old boy!
Well... I like scotch, and we have a scottish terrier. So it seemed only fair to return the love. Hope you get an amazing amount of stuff sent. Looking for an update to the story. Cheers. michael
Stay tuned I'll hopefully have an update post later on in the week :)
Just got the shipping tracking number, it is expected to arrive on wednesday, the 23rd. Hoping there is a huge response for this.
Wowee just in time for Christmas! Good stuff. Thank you!  So far he has received hundreds of cards and that was two days ago - so I'd say so :)
Is it too late to send from the US?.
Not at all! Feel free to send when you can and I'm sure it will get there in time. Thank you!
I probably should've asked before sending it, but I sent a gift of Japanese brown sugar jelly, and:  1. Is he allergic to anything?  2. Will that be a problem at customs?
Not that I know of. And no!
Sent... from Massachusetts, USA. 
Good stuff, thanks!
Just sent a card from Lebanon, New Hmapshire, USA!
My 3 kids sent Aron Xmas cards from Silicon Valley (San Jose) CA, USA tonight! Merry Christmas!
Thank you! Merry Christmas to you :)
Just sent one from today from Santa Cruz, CA 
[deleted]
In case you are curious. Over 2000 cards so far... http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/britains-loneliest-schoolboy-gets-over-7028442
Yup I'm planning an update post this week :)
i believe, given the boys age, his title is "Master" rather than "mister"
Correct. Master can be shortened to Mstr but Mr will do the job just fine. It's not a huge deal. 
Hello, I am interested in sending him a gift and card. I just seen it post online.  Is it too late to send??
Nah I'm sure it would be fine!
so inspiring and beautiful!!! <3
So, I've been wondering if they have arrived? 
The update thread is stickied on the main page!
Thanks
I sent mine off on the 7th, did we ever get any word on the results? 
Check my post history and you'll see the update thread from the other day :)
Has anyone received an update on how many he got, I would be super curious to see a picture with him and all the cards next to him.
If you check my submission history you will see the update thread :)
can someone send me a postcard to send to him?
Where are you from? I live in California, US.  I can try to help if you need a postcard.
Nah it was just a joke, I can probably pick one up at a store by me.
Can someone remind me on Sunday to get this ready please

Reminding you.
Nice one, thank you kindly
Y'all people speak weird.
Coming from the guy that says "y'all people"
You makin fun of the way I speak?
Given that "y'all" is a contraction of "you all", it doesn't make sense.  Should just be "y'all speak weird".  But aye, coming in to a foreign subreddit and saying we speak weird is a bit daft.
To be fair to the lad, go a few miles down the road anywhere in the UK and y'all people speak weird, even as a national.
Seriously I love the accents in the UK.  I was just making a funny.
Maybe he's also addressing the sheep, but doesn't think they speak weird.  Dunno.  Southerners are weird.
As a damn dirty Yank with relatives in Texas, I'm not sure that's right. Y'all is second person singular, and all y'all is the plural. I don't think it's supposed to make grammatical sense with the apostrophe.
'all you all' makes even less sense.
that's how it is, however.
Yet apparently we're the ones who speak weird, ohhh the irony!
I didn't say that, just letting you know that's how it is.
I'm only messing about mate, this is a light hearted post that doesn't need tangential threads about grammatical semantics :p   Hope you're sending a card too!
It's Texas. They had to fight for their own independence without any help from the US, so they make up their own rules. There's a lot of fixin' and all y'all that happens there. We've stopped trying to understand. 
Whats wrong can't take a joke?
Darn tootin'! 
Yes.
I get your joke.
Heathen, why are you drinking fake bru? 
I quite like the new stuff. I had to give up sugary drinks, because I was a fat bastard. But this stuff is a lot closer than Diet Irn Bru.
Aye it was the sugary drinks that made you a fat bastard and no the tower of fry up.
Haha. I'm not OP. I do like towers of fry up tho..
I like Irn Bru Sugar Free. It doesn't taste exactly like the original, but I'm open to variations in flavour. Variety is the spice of life.  (You know what's *real* fake Irn Bru, though? Aldi's “Iron Brew”. It's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Irn Bru.)
>Variety is the spice of life.  Tried that line on the missus when I poked her bum hole.  Didn't go down so well
> I quite like the new stuff.  This us good to know, it hasn't made it's way over the wall AFAK, so I'm stuck with the watery diet shite because fellow fat bastard.
I'd actually go without rather than drink diet Bru
You get used to it. Former fat bastard reporting in.
It's sweeter tasting than the diet stuff. And fruitier I'd say. A close approximation of the real deal.
It gives me the shits. Dunno why, think my body doesn't like something in it.  Also has a funky aftertaste but that just me, everyone else I know likes it.
[deleted]
To be fair, the camera adds a few pounds.
[deleted]
:(
I must admit that it's better than diet but I always find the taste of sweetener abhorrent so I'd rather just have water 
Cos it's sugar free and a lot closer to normal than sugar free irn bru. 
Mushrooms? Flirting with a ban I'd say!
I hope it kills them
Fried in butter... definitely not associated with the S word!
Waste of good butter, tbh.
As someone from the US, do Scots not like mushrooms or something?
**NO SALAD**
It's ok, they're their own kingdom. Closer to meat than salad.
Reported. Sick filth.
You have both top comment and bottom comment in this thread. Ya mad ride.
As an American browsing reddit in bed while just waking up in the morning... I don't have a clear idea what that is, but I want some.
On the left you have link sausage and potato scone with mushrooms on top. On the right you have lorne sausage on the bottom (sausage burger really), the next bit up I'm not 100% but maybe a scotch pie, then black pudding and mushrooms on top. As far as morning rolls go - this is fucking stonking.   But OP can fuck off with the Irn Bru Extra
Sausage burger is a decent summary. Never thought of it like that. Would say square beats bacon for the roll of choice 
God yes, especially if you get a lorne sausage from the butchers. It comes in a terrine shaped block. Cut a chunk off that and make your own "lorne burgers". That's why I made the reference. I own a restaurant and that's what I do every morning for brekkie. Without doubt my cholesterol is high because of it. 2017 n all that shite.  (Already looking forward to my roll tomorrow)
Think it's a white pudding, not a scotch pie. Looks like they've left the packaging on though...
I was swithering between the two. If it's white puddin then it was fried in manky oil - but would make sense if this was bought as a fry up pack from spar.  Kenneth MacAlpin was king of Alba, are you Kenneth MacAlpin? 
I am he.
Get out of here... say... what was it like leading the Picts through the times of Dariada? 
Cannae mind mate, I was fucking blotto for most of the 9th century. Bit ae a blur.
I don't know what Irn Bru is but the rest of that sounds excellent.
It's the nectar of the gods is what it is
I've had the export version. It tasted like a combination of red pop and Tang, but less sweet. Pretty good.
think mountain dew but better while at the same time so much worse
It was a big slice of fruit pudding, not a scotch pie.
Irn Bru Extra!? Oh no we don't drink that! Only Irn Bru
It's actually pretty good
It's alright but for a hangover you need the sugar of a real bru
My typical recovery is don't eat anything until about 4pm, when I'll order a large pepperoni pizza and a 2l of (full fat) Bru. Smash into that and I'll be good to go again in a few hours.    Actually, this might be why I'm getting fat...
Fake bru and fruit instead of haggis. Kill you wi embarrassment mare like. 
It might not kill you today - but it will eventually. Enjoy.

You know if you just weigh out 34 grams of sugar and eat it, you will feel pretty good also, for about 15 minutes. Do people really rely on sugary soda to fix a hangover?

I wish I spoke like that.  I just have the generic American midwest accent with a touch of a southern accent that comes out more the drunker I get.
You want to speak like a wee Glaswegian wifey?
Maybe not so much as the older drunken man counterpart I've seen depicted before.  lol
It might leave you crippled.
It's irn bru extra, isnt gonna do fuck all but make your mouth feel fuzzy.
What kind of heathen puts mushrooms on a roll. Fuckin' disgrace. 
beer commercials are getting stupid
The can must have been your second choice because you didn't have the glass bottle to hand. It's acceptable.
Desperate times call for desperate measures! 
God damn, I miss that about Scotland.  Just can't get a decent roll in the US.
Braw! 
Yaaas. Good effort. Had my square and black pudding rolls this morning. Raring to go. 
Awww man I'm no even out of bed yet! It's 4:20 in the afternoon! (Hehe 420...)
Breakfast of champions!
What is it?
Links and tattie scone in one. Square, fruit pudding and black pudding in the other. 
Should've pied the fruit pud in favour of haggis.
I'm a native English speaker yet understand none of this. 
That's because you need to be a native Scottish English speaker ;) 
To 'pie' something is to ignore/disregard it. So he's saying that Haggis would have been better than Fruit Pudding - and he's not wrong! 
Is fruit pudding just fruit pudding or is it something weird in Scotland?
The [fruit pudding](http://www.kilnford.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fruit-pudding.jpg) in the image is the beige disc in the roll on the right.
The hell, Scotland?
Gotta make sure to get your five a day!
Hawl, less ae that. We've got a reputation tae consider!
I'd love that right now, and any variety of Irn-Bru would make me so happy
That looks fucking excellent. I wish I had this this morning. 
Xtra?whats the difference between that and zero?
It is zero
My cure this morning was a roll and square, black pudding, egg and tomato. There would have been a beer but I had to drive. Bloody forgot to bring Bru
Fuck me I need this. Currently sat in the hoose (Uddingston) and contemplating suicide with this hangover. Consumed my own body weight in steak pie yesterday and what felt like ALL the Whisky available.   Jackie bird though, swear she's an android. She doesn't age!! 
What is this Irn-bru extra and why do I not have this in my life??? Stupid England and. It having enough irn-bru 
I'd kill fer a roll, didnae plan aheed. And ah've feeneeshed the bru a'reedy! Mmm, bacon
looks gross af
